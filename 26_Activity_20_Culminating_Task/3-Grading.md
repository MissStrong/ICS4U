## Grading

This Culminating Task is worth 30% of your overall grade in this course. Each of the three weeks will contribute evenly, meaning **each week is worth 10% of your overall grade**.

You will be receiving a mark out of 30 at the end of each week based on the work you submit at the end of each week. The breakdown of the mark can be found at the bottom of the page with the instructions for that week.

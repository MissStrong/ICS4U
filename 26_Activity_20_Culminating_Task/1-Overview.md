## Overview

The final project for this course will be a game developed using Java with NetBeans. You will be working in a team of three or four to create an original game of your choice. You will be evaluated individually, based on your contribution to the success of the project and your contribution as a team member.

  
## Scenario

A client wants to have a computer game created for their teenage child. They don't care what the game is about, as long as it is fun and age-appropriate. They need the game done by January 24, 2019; no exceptions!

The client is not a software developer, but has done some research and has requested that the following requirements are also to be met, in order to ensure a high-quality program.

* The player needs no background knowledge about Java or computer science to understand the game. 

* A user-friendly GUI is used.

* The instructions for the game are printed to the GUI for the user to read.

* Keyboard and/or mouse controls are user-friendly. 

* It is a modular program that is divided among multiple files.

* Appropriate data types are used.

* Conditional structures are used.

* Loop structures are used.

* Built-in methods and properties are used. 

* Custom methods and classes are created and used. 

* At least one array, array list, set, or dictionary is used. 

* Searching or sorting routines, if any, use built-in methods since they are more efficient than custom-built methods.

* Recursion is used only if it serves an advantage over iteration.

* The code is easily readable and followable by a Java programmer. 

* The code is well documented by including complete JavaDoc comments and meaningful line comments.

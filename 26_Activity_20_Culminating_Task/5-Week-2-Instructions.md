## Week 2 Instructions

Files are to be submitted to the Culminating Task -- Week 2 Dropbox at the end of the week. Submit every written document as a PDF file. It is a group Dropbox, so you can see what your teammates have submitted.

The Week 2 Dropbox closes at Jan 20 at 11:59 PM. If you have not submitted everything by then, you will have to submit the rest later in the Culminating Task -- Week 3 Dropbox.

Commit your work regularly using descriptive commit messages.<br /><br /></li><li>Test each method individually. Be sure to test trivial cases (e.g. empty arrays), and look for errors such as off-by-one errors in loops. Update the software test document with these tests.<br /><br /></li><li>Test each of your classes individually. Update the software test document with these tests.<br /><br /></li><li>Push your code to GitHub. and submit a pull request for your Project Manager to review.

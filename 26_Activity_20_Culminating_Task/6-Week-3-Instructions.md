## Week 3 Instructions

All files (except the final reflection) are to be submitted to the Culminating Task -- Week 3 Dropbox at the end of the week. Submit every written document as a PDF file. It is a group Dropbox, so you can see what your teammates have submitted.

The Week 3 Dropbox closes at Jan 24 at 11:59 PM. No extensions will be granted since this is the last day of this course.

### Task 4: Assemble the final product for the client

| | |

* Any files from Week 1 or 2 that were not submitted on time or have major changes:
 * Software scope document
 * Feasibility study
 * Software test document
 * User guide
 * Up-to-date Gantt chart
* Project as a ZIP file (including all the code, the Javadoc, and the JAR file).
* ZIP file for the client (Just the JAR file, README file, and any media files needed for the game).

### Task 6: Assess your team

Individually assess yourself and your teammates using the Week 3 Team Assessment Form.

### Task 7: Individually, complete the final reflection

In 300-1000 words, respond to all the following prompts.

* What did you enjoy about this project?
* Describe any differences between your final program and what you envisioned when you first started planning your game. What caused some of these differences?
* Describe some of the strategies you used to overcome challenges and difficulties when collaborating with your team members.
* Describe some of the strategies you used to overcome challenges and difficulties when writing your program.
* If you had more time to work on the game independently, what would you change?

Submit your final reflection as a PDF file to the Culminating Task -- Final Reflection Dropbox.

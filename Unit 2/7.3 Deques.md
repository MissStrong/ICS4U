### Deques

A **deque** (pronounced "deck") is a double-ended queue. In other words, it is a stack and a queue combined into one data type. Items get added to or removed frmo the front or back of a deque, and never the middle. 

Java has an interface called `Deque`. Here's [the official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html) for it. Here are some of the static methods from it:

| static methods | description |
| -- | -- |
| `addFirst()` | adds an item to the front of the deque |
| `addLast()` | adds an item to the back of the deque |
| `offerFirst()` | same as `addFirst()`, except it doesn't throw an error if it fails |
| `offerLast()` | same as `addLast()`, except it doesn't throw an error if it fails |
| `removeFirst()` | removes an item from the front of the deque |
| `removeLast()` | removes an item from the back of the deque |
| `pollFirst()` | same as `removeFirst()`, except it doesn't throw an error if it fails |
| `pollLast()` | same as `removelast()`, except it doesn't throw an error if it fails |
| `peekFirst()` | returns the item at the front of the deque |
| `peekLast()` | returns the item at the back of the deque |

The class we'll be using to implement deques is `ArrayDeque`. Here's a demonstration:

```java
/**

import java.util.Deque; // we need to import this to use the Deque data type
import java.util.ArrayDeque; // we need to import this for ArrayDeque()
import java.util.List; // we need to import this for List.of()

public class Main {

    /**
     * Playing with deques.
     *
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		
        Deque<String> colours = new ArrayDeque(List.of("blue", "grey", "green", "yellow")); 
    
        System.out.println(colours); // prints [blue, grey, green, yellow]
        System.out.println(colours.size()); // prints 4
    
        System.out.println(colours.pollFirst()); // prints blue
        System.out.println(colours); // prints [grey, green, yellow]
    
        System.out.println(colours.peekLast()); // prints yellow
        System.out.println(colours.pollLast()); // prints yellow
        System.out.println(colours); // prints [grey, green]
    
        System.out.println(colours.removeFirst()); // prints grey
        colours.offerFirst("purple"); 
        colours.offerLast("orange"); 
        System.out.println(colours); // prints [purple, grey, orange]
    
        colours.clear();
        System.out.println(colours); // prints []
 
    }    
}
```

### Example

An example of a practical application of a queue is priorititizing requests from user when maintaing software. Requests are typically done on a first-come first-serve basis, although more important requests (e.g. vulnerability issues) could "cut in line".

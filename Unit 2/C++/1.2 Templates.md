### Templates
 
Suppose we want to make our own print function so that we don't have to keep typing `cout <<` `<< endl;`. If we want the function to work for various data types, we could overload the function with different data types for the parameter.

```cpp
void print(int n) {
  cout << n << endl;
}

void print(double d) {
  cout << d << endl;
}

void print(string s) {
  cout << s << endl;
}
```

If we use a **template** instead, we could just make one print function.

We declare a template using the following notation:

```cpp
template <typename T> // T is the name used for a generic template, but we can give it any name we want
```

Now we can use `T` in place of a data type as long as we don't use `using namespace std;` anymore.

```cpp
void print(T t) {
  std::cout << t << std::endl;
}
```

Templates are also useful when we want to pass a complicated data type, such as a 2D array, as a parameter.

If we try something like this, it won't work:

```cpp
using namespace std;

void printMatrix(int[][] matrix) { // this line throws an error
  for (const auto& row : matrix) {
    for (int n : row) {
      cout << n;
    } cout << endl;
  }
}
```

If we use a template instead and pass the parameter as a reference using `&`, it will work. The referencing is necessary since arrays are always passed by reference in C++.

```cpp
template <typename Matrix> 
// no "using namespace std;"

void printMatrix(Matrix& matrix) { // this works
  for (const auto& row : matrix) {
    for (int n : row) {
      std::cout << n;
    } std::cout << std::endl;
  }
}
```

`auto` can be used when the compiler can deduce the data type of the object we're declaring, but we can't use it as the data type of a parameter.

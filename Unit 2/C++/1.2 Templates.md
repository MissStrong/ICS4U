TODO

<!-- We've seen `auto&` used in for-each loops. It can be used when the compiler can deduce the data type of the object we're looping through. We can't use `&auto` as the data type of a parameter, but when we need to pass a parameter that has a complicated data type we can make a **template** for it.-->

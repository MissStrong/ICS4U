### Lists and Vectors

**List** and **vectors** are an ordered sequence of items where duplicates are allowed. Unlike arrays, lists and vectors can grow and shrink in size.

Here are some of the pros and cons between them:
* lists are more efficient at adding, inserting, and removing a lot of items
* lists are better at splicing (getting sub-lists)
* vectors are more efficient at accessing particular items

Here is a comparison of some of the ways to use arrays, lists, vector in C++.

| | Arrays | Lists | Vectors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initializing (single-step) | `string numbers[] = {"One", "Two", "Three"};` | `list<string> numbers = {"One", "Two", "Three"};` | `vector<string> numbers = {"One", "Two", "Three"};` |
| Initializing (multi-step) | `string numbers[3];` | `list<string> numbers;` | `vector<string> numbers;` |
| Getting the number of elements | `sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(numbers[0]);` | `numbers.size();` | `numbers.size();` |
| Getting the first item | `numbers[0];` | `numbers.front();` | `numbers.at(0);` |
| Getting the last item (assign `length` to be the number of items) | `numbers[length-1];` | `numbers.back();` | `numbers.at(length-1);` |
| Getting the item at index `n` | `numbers[n];` |  use `next()` with an iterator | `numbers.at(n);` |

Here is a comparision of some of the ways we can add, insert, and remove items in lists and vectors.

| | Lists | Vectors |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Add an item to the back | `numbers.push_back("Four");` | `numbers.push_back("Four");` |
| Add an item to the front | `numbers.push_front("Zero");` | use `insert()` with an iterator |
| Insert an item to a particular index | use `insert()` with an iterator | use `insert()` with an iterator |
| Remove the item at the back | `numbers.pop_back();` | `numbers.pop_back();` |
| Remove the item at the front | `numbers.pop_front();` | use `erase()` with an iterator |
| Remove the item at a particular index | use `erase()` with an iterator | use `erase()` with an iterator |
| Remove a particular item (including all its duplicates) | `numbers.remove("Three");` | use a `for` loop to find the index/indices |

### Iterators

We can use an **iterator** from the `<list>` or `<vector>` file when we need to access an item at a particular index.

The idea is the iterator starts off pointing to a particular index and it can go forward or backwards to another index.

To initialize an iterator, we can use the `auto` since it's a complicated data type. To initialize it to index 0 we use `.begin()`.

```cpp
auto iterator = numbers.begin(); // the iterator points to the first item
```

To move the iterator we can use `advance()`.

```cpp
advance(iterator, 3); // the iterator goes over two spots (it points to the third item now)
```

Now we can use `insert()` and `erase()`.

```cpp
numbers.insert(position, "Four"); // puts "Four" at index 3 and moves everything to the right of it forward one spot
```

```cpp
numbers.erase(position); // erases "Four" moves everything to the right of it backwards one spot
```


<!-- ### Lists or Vectors of Arrays

Lists *cannot* contain arrays as elements. In general they should not be mixed together.

```java
ArrayList<Integer[]> arraylistOfArrays = new ArrayList(); // this doesn't work
``` -->

### Finite Data Representation

Finite data representation refers to the limitations of using a finite amount of space to store data and perform calculations.

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

All computers use a fixed number of bits to represent data. This means that there are limits as to what integers a program can use.  

```cpp
int x = 1000000000000; // doesn't work
```

C++ uses 32-bit data representation for integers: The lowest integer it can store is –2<sup>31</sup> and the highest integer it can store is 2<sup>31</sup> – 1. If we include `<climits>`  (C limits) we can use `MAX_INT` and `MIN_INT` to obtain these values.

When we try to compute a value beyond this domain, it is called **integer overflow** (beyond `MAX_INT`) or **integer underflow** (beyond `MIN_INT`).

### Imprecision of Double and Float

Programming languages tend to be poor at accurately dividing long decimal numbers due to finite data representation. Be aware that if a calculation in any of your programs seems to be off, it might be that our algorithm may be fine and C++ simply can't perform the calculation accurately.

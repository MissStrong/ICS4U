### Maps
 
A map stores pairings of keys and values. All keys are unique and belong to the same data type. Values don't have to be unique but they must belong to the same data type. 


Here are some of the things we can do with maps:

| | Maps | 
| --- | --- |
| Initializing (single-step) | `map<int, string> numbers = {1:"One", 2:"Two", 3:"Three"};` | 
| Initializing (multi-step) | `map<int, string> numbers;` | 
| Getting the number of key-value pairs | `numbers.size();` | 
| Add an item | `numbers.insert(4, "Four");` | 
| Remove a key-value pair | `numbers.erase("Three);` | 
| Remove the key-value pair stored at the front or back | use `erase()` with an iterator | 
| Clear the map | use `erase()` with an iterator | 

Here is a demonstration with maps:

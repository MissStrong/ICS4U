### Maps
 
A map stores pairings of keys and values. All keys are unique and belong to the same data type. Values don't have to be unique but they must belong to the same data type. 


Here are some of the things we can do with maps:

| | Maps | 
| --- | --- |
| Initializing (single-step) | `map<int, string> numbers = {{1, "One"}, {2, "Two"}, {3, "Three"}};` | 
| Initializing (multi-step) | `map<int, string> numbers;` | 
| Getting the number of key-value pairs | `numbers.size();` |
| Check if a key is there | `numbers.count(2) == 1;` | 
| Finding the value of a paricular key | `numbers.at(2);` | 
| Add an item | `numbers.insert(4, "Four");` | 
| Get an iterater pointing at a particular key | `numbers.find(2);` | 
| Remove a key-value pair | use `erase()` with an iterator | 
| Clear the map | use `erase()` with an iterator | 

We can use a for-each loop to go through the key-value pairs of a map if we bind each key and value with `[]` and reference it with `&`.

```cpp
for (auto& [key, value] : map) { // this uses structured binding
  // do something with key and value
}
```

Here is a demonstration with maps:

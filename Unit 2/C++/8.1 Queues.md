### Queues

A **queue** (pronounced like the letter "Q") is a collection of items that are lined up. Items get added to the back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue. Another way of saying *remove an item* is **dequeue** (pronounced D.Q.) and another way of saying *add an item* is **enqueue** (pronounced N.Q.).

This system is called *First In, First Out*. The items that are added the earliest are the ones that get removed the earlist.

Here is [the documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/queue) of all of the functions in `<queue>`.

Here's a demonstration of a stack:

```cpp
/**
 * @author MissStrong
 */

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Prints a queue in the form [item1, item2, ..., itemN].
 */
void printQueue(queue<string> queue) {
  string delimiter = "[";
  if (queue.empty()) {
    cout << delimiter;
  } while (!queue.empty()) {
    cout << delimiter << queue.front();
    queue.pop(); // queue is a copy of the original so this won't mess up the original one
    delimiter = ", ";
  } cout << "] " << endl;
}

/**
 * Playing with queues.
 *
 * @return 0 if successful, 1 if unsuccessful
 */
int main() {
  queue<string> colours;
  colours.push("blue");
  colours.push("grey");
  colours.push("green");
  colours.push("yellow");
  
  cout << colours.size() << endl; // prints 4
  
  printQueue(colours); // prints [blue, grey, green, yellow] 

  cout << colours.front() << endl; // prints yellow
  colours.pop();

  printQueue(colours); // prints [grey, green, yellow] 

  cout << colours.front() << endl; // prints grey
  colours.pop();

  printQueue(colours); // prints [green, yellow] 

  colours.push("orange");

  printQueue(colours); // prints [green, yellow, orange] 

  colours = {}; // clears the queue

  printQueue(colours); // prints []
}
```

### Example

An example of a practical application of a queue is priorititizing requests from userw when maintaing software.Requests are typically done on a first-come first-serve basis, although more important requests (e.g. vulnerability issues) could "cut in line".  -->

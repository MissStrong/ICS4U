### 2D Arrays
 
In C++, the term **2D array** is used for arrays whose *elements* are 1D arrays. Each inner array represents a row of the 2D array.

The following table can be represented using the 2D array `{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}`.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Initializing 2D Arrays

To initialize the 2D array above, we can do the following.

```java
int matrix[3][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}; // a matrix is a rectangular table of numbers
```

The notation `[][]` is used for an array of arrays.

The width of the matrix doesn't need to be stated for the same reason we don't need to state the length of a 1D array when we are declaring and initializing it on the same line, but we do need to include its height.

```java
int matrix[][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}; // this still works without the [3]
```

Another way to initialize a 2D array is to specify its width and height and list all the items let it figure out which items go in which row based on the order they appear in.

```java
int matrix[3][2] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // this works too!
```

If we change the width and height, we'll get a different shape.

```java
int matrix[2][3] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // this has different dimensions than the one above; see below
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Printing 2D Arrays

We can simulate printing a 2D array by printing its rows individually.

To print the 2D array above, we can do the following.

```cpp
int matrixWidth = 3
int matrixHeight = 2

for (int i = 0; i < matrixWidth; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < matrixHeight; j++) {
    cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```

### Searching Through 2D Arrays

If we try to do a for-each loop on the 2D array, we may run into issues.

```cpp

```cpp
for (int[] row : matrix) { // this line throws an error
  for (int n : row) {
    // ...
  } 
}
```

We can search through a 2D array by searching each row one at a time using the `auto` keyword that automatically detects the data type, but the rows need to be referenced using `&`. We can also declare each row as a constant using `const` so that we don't accidentally modify them.

```cpp
int secretNumber = 4;
bool found = false;

for (const auto& row : matrix) { // auto allows us to declare a complicated data type within a for-each loop
  for (int n : row) {
    if (n == secretNumber) {
      found = true;
      break;
    }
  } if (found) break;
}

string answer = found ? "Found it!" : "Did not find it."; // this is a ternary operator
cout << answer << endl;
```

The `auto` keyword is used because we can't otherwise use a for-each loop in a 2D array (`int row[] : matrix` doesn't work).

The ternary operator is an alternative to if-else. It takes the form `boolean expression ? what to do if true : what to do if false`.

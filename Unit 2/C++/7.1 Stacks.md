### Stacks

A **stack** is a collection of items that are "stacked" on top of each other. Items get added and removed from the top of the stack. Another way of saying *remove an item* is **pop** and another way of saying *add an item* is **push**.

This system is called *Last In, First Out*. The items that are added the latest are the ones that get removed the earlist.

Here is [the documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack) for all of the functions in `<stack>`.

Here's a demonstration of a stack:

```cpp
/**
 * @author MissStrong
 */

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Prints a stack in the form [item1, item2, ..., itemN].
 */
void printStack(stack<string> stack) {
  string delimiter = "[";
  if (stack.empty()) {
    cout << delimiter;
  } while (!stack.empty()) {
    cout << delimiter << stack.top();
    stack.pop(); // stack is a copy of the original so this won't mess up the original one
    delimiter = ", ";
  } cout << "] " << endl;
}

/**
 * Playing with stacks.
 *
 * @return 0 if successful, 1 if unsuccessful
 */
int main() {
  stack<string> colours;
  colours.push("blue");
  colours.push("grey");
  colours.push("green");
  colours.push("yellow");
  
  cout << colours.size() << endl; // prints 4
  
  printStack(colours); // prints [yellow, green, grey, blue] 

  cout << colours.top() << endl; // prints yellow
  colours.pop();

  printStack(colours); // prints [green, grey, blue] 

  cout << colours.top() << endl; // prints green
  colours.pop();

  printStack(colours); // prints [green, grey, blue]

  colours.push("orange");

  printStack(colours); // prints [orange, grey, blue] 

  colours = {}; // clears the stack

  printStack(colours); // prints []
}
```

### Example

An example of a practical application of a stack is your browser history. Every time you visit a new webpage, it gets added to the top of your browser history. Every time you hit "back", it removes the webpage you were just at from the stack, and brings you back to the most previously visited webpage. Of course, you can jump back more than one page at once, which a stack doesn't have to do, but the basic operations of web browsing follow a stack.

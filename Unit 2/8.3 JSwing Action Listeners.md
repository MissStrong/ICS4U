### JSwing Action Listeners

An **action listener** is a part of a program that "listens" for a particular to event to happen. For example, it could be waiting for a button to be pressed. We use action listeners to add functionality to buttons.

Here is an example of an action listener:

```Java
JButton clickMeButton = new JButton("Click Me");
// Makes the button do something
clickMeButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {  
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    // Prints the message when the button is clicked
    System.out.println("You clicked the button!")
  }
});
```

### JSwing Key Listeners

Similar to an action listener, key listeners "listen" for a specific key to be pressed or released.

For example, we can allow a user to press ENTER to as a keyboard shortcut for pressing a button. Key listeners are added to components, so the keyboard shortcut will only work when your cursor is in the component with the key listener.

```java
textFieldName.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() { 
  public void keyReleased(KeyEvent evt) {
    // VK_Enter is the key code for the ENTER key
    if (evt.getKeyCode() == VK_ENTER) {
      // Do something here
    }
  }
});
```

The full list of key codes is in the Java Docs: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html.

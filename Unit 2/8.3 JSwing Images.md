### JSwing Image Icons

We can use the `ImageIcon` class to display images on `JLabel` and `JButton` objects.

We can use the following code to create an image icon for an image called icon.jpg as long as it's in the same location as *Main.java*.

```java
ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("icon.jpg");
```

If the image is in a folder (not in the same location as *Main.java*), we can put "folder_name/" (with the actual name of the folder) in front of the filename. 

```java
ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("Images/icon.jpg");
```

To place this image onto`JLabel`, we can use the following code:

```java
JLabel imageLabel = new JLabel();

// set up imageLabel here

imageLabel.setIcon(icon);
```

If your label and image have the same dimensions, the image should fit perfectly. If possible, crop and/or resize your images before importing them into your program. 

To retrieve the current image on a label, we can use this:

```java
buttonName.getIcon();
```

To remove an image from a label, we can use this:

```java
buttonName.setIcon(null);
```

### Enumerations

In Java, an `enum` (short for **enumeration**) is like a class combined with an array. It is used for defining an ordered sequence of constant-like values and can help make programs more readable than using an arrays of constants.

Suppose we have a program that uses the days of the week. One option is to declare each of the days of the week as a constant and place them inside an array:

```java
final int MONDAY = 0, TUESDAY = 1, WEDNESDAY = 2, THURSDAY = 3, FRIDAY = 4, SATURDAY = 5, SUNDAY = 6;

final int[] daysOfTheWeek = {MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY};
```

Here is what it looks like if we use `enum` instead. In CodeHS, this block of code can be placed inside of a class or in its own file with a matching filename.

```java
public enum DayOfTheWeek {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
}
```

Since the days of the week are treated like constants, they are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Since enumerations are like classes, the name of an `enum` is written in UpperCamelCase.

Not only does the program becomes more concise and readable with the use of `enum`, we also don't lose any functionality.

If we want to print all the days of the week followed by its value, we can do this:

```java
for (DayOfTheWeek d : DayOfTheWeek.values()) { // goes through all the values
    System.out.println(d.name() + ": " + d.ordinal()); // prints the day as a string followed by its "index"
}
```

```
MONDAY: 0
TUESDAY: 1
WEDNESDAY: 2
THURSDAY: 3
FRIDAY: 4
SATURDAY: 5
SUNDAY: 6
```

To access an individual enum value, we need to indicate which enum structure it's from.

```java
System.out.println(DaysOfTheWeek.MONDAY); // prints MONDAY
System.out.println(DaysOfTheWeek.MONDAY.name()); // prints MONDAY
System.out.println(DaysOfTheWeek.MONDAY.ordinal()); // prints 0
```

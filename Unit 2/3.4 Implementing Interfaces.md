### Implementing an Interface

An interface doesn't have any fields and all its methods have empty bodies. When a subclass `implements` an interface, it must include the definitions of all the methods from the interface.

Here is an example of a custom class that implements a custom interface. 


```java
// Shapes.java

public interface Shape {    
  
    public double perimeter(); 
    public double area();
}
```

The rest of the program is the same as the previous example with `extends Shape` replaced with `implements Shape`.

Interfaces have a few things in common with abstract classes. Neither can be instantiated and both act as a template for its subclasses. However, there are also some key differences between them. 

* Interfaces have no fields. Abstract classes may have fields.
* All methods in an interface are abstract by default (you don't need the `abstract` keyword). Not all methods in an abstract class need to be abstract.
* A subclass can inherit multiple interfaces, but at most one class.

When deciding between an abstract class and an interface in your program, consider the differences above.

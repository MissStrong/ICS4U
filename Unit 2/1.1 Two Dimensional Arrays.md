### 2D Arrays

In Java, the term **2D array** is used for arrays whose *elements* are 1D arrays. Each inner array represents a row of the 2D array.

The following table can be represented using the 2D array `{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}`.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Initializing 2D Arrays

To initialize the 2D array above, we can do the following.

```java
int[] row0 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] row1 = {4, 5, 6};
int[] row2 = {7, 8, 9};
int[][] matrix = {row0, row1, row2}; // a matrix is a rectangular table of numbers
```

The notation `[][]` is used for an array of arrays.

### Printing 2D Arrays

We can simulate printing a 2D array by printing its rows individually.

To print the 2D array above, we can do the following.

```java
for (int[] row : matrix) {
  System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
}
```

### Searching Through 2D Arrays

We can search through a 2D array by searching each row one at a time.

```java
int secretNumber = 7;
boolean found = false;

for (int[] row : matrix) {
  for (int n : row) {
    if (n == secretNumber) {
      found = true;
      break;
    }
  } if (found) break;
}

System.out.println(found ? "Found it!" : "Did not find it."); // this is a ternary operator
```

The ternary operator on the last line is an alternative to if-else. It takes the form `boolean expression ? what to do if true : what to do if false`.

### Collection

In Java, **Collection** is a blueprint for data types that involve storing a collection of items. Collections and grow and shrink in size.

[The official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) for `Collection` shows all the non-static methods that a `Collection` comes with. Here are a few of them:

| non-static method | description | 
| --- | --- |
| `add()` | puts a new item into the collection |
| `contains()` | checks whether an item is in the collection |
| `clear()` | removes all the items in a collection|
| `equals()`| checks whether two collections contain the same items|
| `isEmpty()` | checks whether a collection is empty |
| `remove()` | removes a single item from the colelction |
| `size()` | gets the total number of items in a collection |

`Collection` is an **interface**, which is similar to a superclass except it doesn't have a constructor so we have to specify what type of collection we want to make. The ones we're going to focus on in the subsequent lessons are:

* `ArrayList`
* `HashSet`
* `Stack`
* `PriorityQueue`
* `ArrayDeque` (Bonus Unit)
* `LinkedList` (Bonus Unit)

There's also a class called `Collections` that has many static methods that can be used when we we `import java.util.Collections;`. Here is [the official documentation]([https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html)

Here are some static methods that may be particularly useful.

| static method | description |
| --- | --- |
| `Collections.frequency()` | counts the number of times an item appears in a collection |
| `Collections.max()` | finds the maximum valued item in a collection |
| `Collections.min()` | finds the minimum valued item in a collection |
| `Collections.reverse()` | reverses the order of the items in a collection |
| `Collections.shuffle()` | randomizes the order of the items in collection |
| `Collections.sort()` | sorts the collection in lexicographical order |

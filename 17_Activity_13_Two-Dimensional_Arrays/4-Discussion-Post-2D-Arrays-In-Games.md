## 2D Arrays in Games

This discussion topic is the same as Arrays in Games, except it will be about 2D arrays instead of 1D arrays.

Pick a game that you are familiar with and write about how you would use a 2-dimensional arrays to create a Java version of the game. Don't pick Battleship!

Include the following information:

* a description of the game
* what kind of 2D arrays you would use
* what values you would store in the 2D arrays
* how you would use the 2D arrays
* how difficult it would be to create the program

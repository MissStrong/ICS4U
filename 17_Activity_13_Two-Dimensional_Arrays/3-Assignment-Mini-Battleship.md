## Assignment: Mini Battleship

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Mini Battleship Dropbox.

Battleship is a classic board game that I hope most of you are familiar with. If you haven't played it before, or need a refresher, you can watch this video: [How To Play Battleship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0qpQ8doUp8).


### Instructions

1. Create a new project in NetBeans and call it "Mini Battleship".
2. Create a GUI that allows you to play a miniature version of Battleship against a computer. You will be finding the computer's ships.
  * The grid is 4 by 4, as opposed to the traditional 10 by 10 grid.
  * There is only one ship, opposed to the traditional five ships.
  * The ship is randomly placed somewhere on the grid at the beginning of each game. The ship takes up three cells.
  * Each cell is a button, which the user can press to try to find the ship.
  * When the user presses a button where the ship is hiding, the button turns into a red circle. When the user presses a button where the ship isn't hiding, the button turns into a white circle.
  * You may use these images for the red and white circles: [red.png](../Images/red.png), [white.png](../Images/white.png) (Tip: These images work well when the buttons are 100 pixels by 100 pixels.) You may also create your own images.
  * The game ends when the user finds the entire ship.
3. When the program works, zip the file and name it **Assignment 11 - \<insert your name here>.zip**.
4. Submit the following to the Dropbox:
  * A .zip file of the program.
  * A .txt file (or a .docx file or a .rtf file) containing all of the code in the .java file.
  * A self-evaluation using the rubric below. 
 
### Rubric

The following rubric will be used to evaluate your assignment. Each row counts for 4 points, for a total of 32 points.

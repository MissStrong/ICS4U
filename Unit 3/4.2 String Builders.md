# String Immutability

Strings are **immutable** in Java, meaning you cannot change them once you create them. When you "modify" a string, what you are actually doing is creating a whole new string that happens to have the same name as the old one. As a result, you can end up with a lot of unusable strings taking up space in your computer's memory.

```java
String text = "hi"; // creates a string
text = text + "!"; // creates a new string with the same name, but doesn't delete the old one from memory
```

# String Builder

`StringBuilder` solves this problem of strings wasting space.

Consider this string:

```java
String result = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    result = result + i + " ";
}
```

The final value of `result` is "01234"`, but all of its previous values are taking up unecessary space in your computer's memory.

Here is what the same process looks like with `StringBuilder`.

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    sb.append(i).append(" ");
}

String result = sb.toString();
```

Here is the documentation for `StringBuilder`: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html

Since it's in `java.lang`, we don't need to import it to use it.

Here are some common static methods for `StringBuilder`.

| non-static method | description | 
| --- | --- |
| `append()` | adds text to the end  |
| `insert()` | inserts text at a specific index |
| `delete()` | removes characters between two indices |
| `deleteChatAt()` | removes a character at a specific index |
| `reverse()` | reverses the sequence |
| `toString()` | converts the string builder into a string |

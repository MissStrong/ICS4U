### XML Basics

**XML** stands for **Extensible Markup Language**. Markup languages are used to format and structure text. They use **tags** to define various types of elements in a documents. Tags are user-defined and surround the text that they are structuring. Opening tags are in the form `<tagName>` and closing tags are in the form `</tagName>`

Here is an example of XML:

```xml
<book>
  <title>AI with Intention<title>
  <author>Tony Frontier</author>
  <year>2025</2025>
  <genre>education</genre>
  <publisher>ASCD</publisher>
  <rating>5/5<rating>
</book>
```

The tags are `book`, `author`, `year`, `genre`, `publisher`, and `rating`.

In this course, we'll only be dealing with XML files that have:

* only one layer of nesting
* no self-closing tags
* no attributes inside tags

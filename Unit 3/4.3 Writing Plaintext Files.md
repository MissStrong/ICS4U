### Writing Plaintext Files

There are several classes to choose from when we are writing to files. The one I recommend is `BufferedWriter`.

```java
/**
 * @author MissStrong
 */

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;

public class Main {
    /**
     * Creates a file called output.txt and writes "Hello!" to it.
     *
     * @param args the command line arguments
     * @throws java.io.IOException when the output file is not writable
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try {
            FileWriter file = new FileWriter("output.txt");
            // buffer is going to keep track of what will be written to output.txt
            BufferedWriter buffer = new BufferedWriter(file);
            // this prints "Hello!" to output.txt
            buffer.write("Hello!");
            buffer.close()
        } catch(IOException exception) {
            // If output.txt is not writable, information about this error gets printed to the console
           System.err.println("Error: Cannot write to file. ");
       } 
    } 
} 
```

### Regular Expressions

We can use the `<regex>` header to implement regular expressions.


```cpp
#include <regex>
```

Then, we can create a regex object for a pattern use `regex_search()` to check whether a string is an exact match for that pattern. Don't forget to escape the backslashes and non-regex characters in the pattern!

```cpp
regex phoneRegex = regex("\\([0-9]{3}\\) [0-9]{3}\\-[0-9]{4}");  // this is the pattern for phone numbers that looks like this: (___) ___-____

string bciPhone = "(555) 555-5555"; // BCI's phone number

if (regex_search(bciPhone, phoneRegex)) {
  cout << "The pattern matches." << endl; // this gets printed since BCI's phone number is written with the same pattern
} else {
  cout << "The pattern doesn't match." << endl;
}
```

A more common appoach to the first line is to use parentheses to declare the variable instead of calling the `regex()` constructor.

```cpp
regex phoneRegex("\\([0-9]{3}\\) [0-9]{3}\\-[0-9]{4}");  // this works too
```

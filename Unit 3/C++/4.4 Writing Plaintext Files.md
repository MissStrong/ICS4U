## Writing Plaintext Files


Here is an example for writing words to a plaintext file called `file.txt`.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream file; // ofstream stands for "output file string"
  file.open("file.txt"); // opens the file for us to write to
  file << "Hello!"; // write "Hello World!" to the file
  file.close(); // optional
}
```

When using any programming language, it is good housekeeping to close any files that we opened soon after we're done using them. This helps prevents the files from getting overwritten or damaged.

However, in C++, we do not have to explicitly write `file.close();` since files are automatically closed after they are done being used.

## Writing Plaintext Files


To read a file we need to include `<fstream>`, which stands for *file stream*. Then we can create an `ofstream` (*output file stream*) object using a plaintext file.

Here is an example for writing words to a plaintext file called "file.txt". **Caution:** If "file.txt" already existed, it will get overwritten!

```cpp
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream file;
  file.open("file.txt"); // creates and opens the file for us to write to
  file << "Hello!" << endl; // writes "Hello!" to the file
  file.close(); // optional
}
```

When using any programming language, it is good housekeeping to close any files that we opened soon after we're done using them. This helps prevents the files from getting overwritten or damaged.

However, in C++, we do not have to explicitly write `file.close();` since files are automatically closed after they are done being used.

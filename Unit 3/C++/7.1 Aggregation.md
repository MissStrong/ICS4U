### Aggregation

**Aggregation** is one of the three ways in which class can be associated with other classes. (The other two are *composition* and *inheritance*, which we'll see later.)

Aggregation occurs when a class (called the **superclass** or **parent class**) has a field that is an object belonging to another class (called the **subclass** or the **child class**). For example, if we have a class called `BoardGame` which represents a board game, we might have a field that represents the dice that are used in the game from a `Die` class.

Aggregation is often referred to as a "has-a" association. In the example above, a `BoardGame` has-a `Die`. 

Typically, in aggregation, the subclass can exist independly of the superclass. For example, once a board game is finished, the dice could still be used in the program for other purposes. Thus, when the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Die` object isn't necessarily destroyed with it. The two classes may look something like this.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Die {

  private:
  
    int numSides;

  public: 

    Die(int numSides) { 
      this->numSides = numSides;
    }

    int roll() {
      srand(time(NULL));
      return rand() % this->numSides + 1; // random integer between 1 and numSides (highest face)
    }
};

class BoardGame {

  private:

    vector<Die> dice; // a vector of dice

  public: 

    BoardGame(Die &d1, Die &d2) { // takes the dice as references instead of copies so that we're using the original Die objects
      this->dice.push_back(d1);
      this->dice.push_back(d2);
    }
    
    int rollDice() {
      int sum = 0;
      for (Die d : this->dice) {
        sum += d.roll();
      }
      return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
  Die *d1 = new Die(6);
  Die *d2 = new Die(6);
  BoardGame *game = new BoardGame(*d1, *d2);
  
  cout << game->rollDice() << endl; //  prints a result between 2 and 12
  
  delete game; // "delete" calls the destructor (see below)
  delete d1;
  delete d2;
}
```

### Destructors

A **destructor** is a method that removes objects from memory. Every time we dynamically create an object by calling a constructor, we should also call a destructor once we're done with it. We don't have to worry about calling destructors for objects in which we didn't directly call the constructor.

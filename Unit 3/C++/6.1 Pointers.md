### Pointers

A **pointer** is a variable that stores an **address**. For example, when we initialize an array, the variable name is actually storing the address of the first item in the array.

Since items in an array are stored in contiguous spots, we just need to know where the first one is and the total number of them in order to access all of them.

```cpp
int array[] = {1, 2, 3};
int arrayLength = 3;

for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
  cout << "Item " << i << " is at " << array + i << endl;
}
```
```
Item 0 is at 0x7ffea8d18230
Item 1 is at 0x7ffea8d18234
Item 2 is at 0x7ffea8d18238
```

If we want to know the value that is stored at a particular address, we can use the **dereferencing operator** `*` in front of the address. `*(array + index)` does the same thing as `array[index]`.


```cpp
int array[] = {1, 2, 3};
int arrayLength = 3;

for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
  cout << array + i << " is storing " << *(array + i) << endl;
}
```
```
0x7ffea8d18230 is storing 1
0x7ffea8d18234 is storing 2
0x7ffea8d18238 is storing 3
```


We can create our own pointers using the **pointer declaration operator**, which also happens to be `*`. To get the address of a variable, we use the **address operator** `&`

```cpp
int n = 10;
cout << "n is "  << n << endl;
cout << "&n is " << &n << endl; // address of n

int *p = &n; // stores the address of n in our pointer p
cout << "p is " << p << endl; // value of p is the address of n
cout << "*p is " << *p << endl;
```

```
n is 10
&n is 0x7fffed567c5c
p is 0x7fffed567c5c
*p is 10
```

Note that `*` in `int *p = &n;` is used to declare that `p` is a pointer to an integer whereas the `*` in the `*p << endl;` is used to get the integer that is stored in the address that p is storing.

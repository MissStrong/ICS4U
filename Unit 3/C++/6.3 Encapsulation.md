### Encapsulation

In order to directly access a **field** (variable or constant) in an object from outside its class, it has to be `public`. However, declaring a variable as `public` allows the user to modify its value. 

```cpp
Person *nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);
nancy->age = -30;
cout << nancy->age << endl; // prints -30 instead of 57
```

To get around this, we can make the fields `private` and create a public method, called a **getter** to *get* the value of the field.

This concept of data hiding is called **encapsulation**. The "capsule" in this case would be the class.

Here is an example of encapsulation with the `Person`Â example from before.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person {

  private: // this prevents the user from tampering with the three fields

    string name; 
    string gender;
    int age;
  
  public: // this allows us to call these methods outside the class

    Person(string n, string g, int a) {
      this->name = n;
      this->gender = g;
      this->age = a;
    }

    string getName() {
      return this->name;
    }

    string getGender() {
      return this->gender;
    }
	
    int getAge() {
      return this->age;
    }
};

int main() {
  Person *nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);

  cout << nancy->getName() << endl; // prints "Nancy"
  cout << nancy->getGender() << endl; // prints "Female"
  cout << nancy->getAge() << endl; // prints 57
} 
```

Now suppose we want to allow the user to able to modify the fields from outside of the class, but we want to ensure they enter valid values. For example, we don't want them to be able to change the age to a negative number. We can create public methods called **setters** that *set* the values of the fields if the values the user provided are valid.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person {

  private: // this prevents the user from tampering with the three fields

    string name; 
    string gender;
    int age;
  
  public: // this allows us to call these methods outside the class

    Person(string n, string g, int a) {
      this->name = n;
      this->gender = g;
      this->age = a;
    }

    string getName() {
      return this->name;
    }

    string getGender() {
      return this->gender;
    }
	
    int getAge() {
      return this->age;
    }
  
    void setName(string n) {
      this->name = n;
    }
	
    void setGender(string g) {
      this->gender = g;
    }
	
    void setAge(int a) {
      if (a > 0) { // prevents the age from being set to a negative number
        this->age = a;
      } else {
        cerr << "Error: Cannot change age to negative number." << endl;
      }
    }
};

int main() {
  Person *nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);

  nancy->setAge(-30); // tries to set the age to -30 but it ends up staying at 57
  cout << nancy->getName() << endl; // prints "Nancy"
  cout << nancy->getGender() << endl; // prints "Female"
  cout << nancy->getAge() << endl; // prints 57 instead of -30
}
```

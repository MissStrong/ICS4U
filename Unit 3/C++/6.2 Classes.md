### Objects

An **object** is an instance (i.e. a concrete occurrence) of a class. For example, if we have the string `"Hello World!"` somewhere our our program, it would be a `string` object. 

A **class** is a blueprint for an object. It contains the properties of the object, including variables (**fields**) and functions (methods). A class has at least one constructor, which shares the same name as the class and doesn't have any return type (not even `void`). 

### Classes

Here is an example of a custom class `Person`

```cpp
class Person {

  public: // this allows us to refer to the properties of Person from outside the class

  string name;
  string gender;
  int age;

  Person() { // this is a constructor
    name = ""; 
    gender = "";
    age = -1;
  }

  Person(string n, string g, int a) { // this is also a constructor
    name = n;
    gender = g;
    age = a;
  }
}
```

There are two versions of the constructor `Person()`. The first one doesn't take any parameters and just sets the three fields (`name`, `gender`, and `age`) to some default values. The second one takes three parameters and sets the fields to these values. We can choose which one to call when we create an instance of a `Person`.

In `main()`, we can create a `Person` using either of the two constructors and access the fields we initized. The constructor will give us the address of the object, so we need to initialize the variable as a pointer and dereference it when we are accessing its fields.

```cpp
int main() {
  Person *nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);

  System.out.println((*nancy).name); // prints "Nancy"
  System.out.println((*nancy).gender); // prints "Female"
  System.out.println((*nancy).age); // prints "57"
} 
```

Instead of `(*pointer).field`, we can use the **arrow operator** `pointer->field` to do the exact same thing.


```cpp
int main() {
  Person *nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);

  System.out.println(nancy->name); // prints "Nancy"
  System.out.println(nancy->gender); // prints "Female"
  System.out.println(nancy->age); // prints "57"
} 
```

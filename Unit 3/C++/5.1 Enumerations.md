### Enumerations

In C++, an `enum` (short for **enumeration**) is used for defining an ordered sequence of constant-like values.

Suppose we have a program that uses the days of the week and we need to assign each day of the week a number. One option is to declare each of the days of the week as a constant.

```cpp
const int MONDAY = 0, TUESDAY = 1, WEDNESDAY = 2, THURSDAY = 3, FRIDAY = 4, SATURDAY = 5, SUNDAY = 6;
```

Here is what it looks like if we use `enum` instead.  This will initialize `MONDAY` to `0`, `TUESDAY` to `1`, and so on.

```cpp
enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
};
```

Since the days of the week are treated like constants, they are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Since enumerations are like classes, the name of an `enum` is written in UpperCamelCase.

```cpp
int main() {
  for (int day = MONDAY; day <= SUNDAY; day++) {
    cout << day << endl;
  }
}
```

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

There isn't a built-in way for us to get the name of an enum based on its value, so if we want to get the days of the week as strings we can write a function to do that.

```cpp
/* Gets the name of the day of each week by its day number.
 *
 * @param dayNum the day number
 * @return the name of the day of the week, or "Not a day" if it's not a valid day number
 */
string getDayName(int dayNum) {
  switch(dayNum) {
    case MONDAY:
      return "Monday";
    case TUESDAY:
      return "Tuesday";
    case WEDNESDAY:
      return "Wednesday";
    case THURSDAY:
      return "Thursday";
    case FRIDAY:
      return "Friday";
    case SATURDAY:
      return "Saturday";
    case SUNDAY:
      return "Sunday";
    default:
      return "Not a day";
  }
}
```

Now we can see the day of the week based on its number.

```cpp
int main() {
  for (int day = MONDAY; day <= SUNDAY; day++) {
    string dayName = getDayName(day);
    if (dayName != "Not a day") {
      cout << dayName << ": " << day << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

```
Monday: 0
Tuesday: 1
Wednesday: 2
Thursday: 3
Friday: 4
Saturday: 5
Sunday: 6
```

By default, enums start at 0 and increase by 1. We can change any of the values using the `=` operator. If we do that, they still go up by 1 for the value we don't specify.


```cpp
enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY = 1, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY // Now Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, and so on
};
```

```cpp
enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY = 5, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY // Now Monday is 1, Tuesday is 5, Wednesday is 6, and so on
};
```

We can also assign them all to be whatever integers we want. 

```cpp
enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY = 4, TUESDAY = 7, WEDNESDAY = 8, THURSDAY = 17, FRIDAY = 82, SATURDAY = 492, SUNDAY = 9001
};
```

If we do this though our loop won't work unless the first number is the lowest and the last value is the highest.


```cpp
int main() {
  for (int day = MONDAY; day <= SUNDAY; day++) {
    string dayName = getDayName(day);
    if (dayName != "Not a day") {
      cout << dayName << ": " << day << endl;
    }
  }
}
```

```
Monday: 4
Tuesday: 7
Wednesday: 8
Thursday: 17
Friday: 82
Saturday: 492
Sunday: 9001
```

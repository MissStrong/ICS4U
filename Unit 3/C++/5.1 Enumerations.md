### Enumerations

In C++, an `enum` (short for **enumeration**) is like a class combined with an array. It is used for defining an ordered sequence of constant-like values and can help make programs more readable than using an arrays of constants.

Suppose we have a program that uses the days of the week. One option is to declare each of the days of the week as a constant and place them inside an array:

```cpp
const int MONDAY = 0, TUESDAY = 1, WEDNESDAY = 2, THURSDAY = 3, FRIDAY = 4, SATURDAY = 5, SUNDAY = 6;

const int daysOfTheWeek[] = {MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY};
```

Here is what it looks like if we use `enum` instead. In Replit, this block of code has to be placed inside of a class, but in other IDEs it can be placed inside or outside a class.

```cpp
enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
};
```

Since the days of the week are treated like constants, they are written in *SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE*. Since enumerations are like classes, the name of an `enum` is written in *UpperCamelCase case*, just like a class is.

[IN PROGRESS]

<!-- Not only does the program becomes more concise and readable with the use of `enum`, we also don't lose any functionality.

If we want to print all the days of the week followed by its value, we can do this:

```cpp
for (DayOfTheWeek d : DayOfTheWeek.values() {
  cout << d + ": " + d.ordinal() << endl;
}
```

Now suppose we want to pair each day of the week with some additional information. We can do that by adding a **field** for the additional information and a **constructor** that takes in the additional as a parameter. Constructors are methods that create objects (in this case, it creates an enum for each day of the week) and fields are properties that objects have. We can access fields using the notation `object.field` (replace `object` with the object and `field` with the field).


```cpp
public enum DayOfTheWeek {
  
  MONDAY("Alright let's get this day over with."), 
  TUESDAY("Oh good, Monday is over."),
  WEDNESDAY("Halfway through the week!"), 
  THURSDAY("It's almost Friday."), 
  FRIDAY("It's almost the weekend!"), 
  SATURDAY("Zzzzzzz."), 
  SUNDAY("Oh no, it's Monday tomorrow.");
  
  const String message; // creates a field called "message" that goes with each day of the week

  DayOfTheWeek(String s) { // this is the constructor
    this.message = s; // sets the message to the argument that was passed in (we're going to learn more about "this" later this unit)
  }
  
}
```

Now we can print the message that goes with each day of the week.

```cpp
for (DayOfTheWeek d : DayOfTheWeek.values()) {
  System.out.println(d + ": " + d.message);
}
```

```
MONDAY: Alright let's get this day over with.
TUESDAY: Oh good, Monday is over.
WEDNESDAY: Halfway through the week!
THURSDAY: It's almost Friday.
FRIDAY: It's almost the weekend!
SATURDAY: Zzzzzzz.
SUNDAY: Oh no, it's Monday tomorrow.

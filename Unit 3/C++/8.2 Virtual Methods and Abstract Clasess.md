### Virtual Methods

A **virtual method** is a method in a superclass whose implementation is overridable. 

When the implementation is missing, it is already considered a virtual method.

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
   double perimeter(); // these two methods are virtual
   double area();
};
```

To ensure that the method does get overriden in the subclass, we can add the `virtual` keyword and append `= 0`. This will make it a **pure virtual method**.

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
   virtual double perimeter() = 0;
   virtual double area() = 0;
};
```

If the implementation is not missing, we need to use the keyword `virtual` to make it overridable.

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
    virtual double perimeter() {
     return -1; // just a placeholder
    }

    virtual double area() {
     return -1; // just a placeholder
    }
};
```


### Abstract Classes

**Abstract classes** are classes that contain at lease one pure virtual method. A class that is not an abstract class is a **concrete class**. 

We cannot call the constructor of an abstract classes, since they are not meant to be instantiated. Here is the example from before rewritten to include `abstract`.

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
    virtual double perimeter() = 0;
    virtual double area() = 0;
};

class Rectangle: public Shape {

  public:
  
    double length;
    double width;
    int numSides;
	    
    Rectangle(double side1, double side2) {
      numSides = 4;
      length = max(side1, side2);
      width = min(side1, side2);
    }
	    
    double perimeter() {
      return 2 * (length + width);
    }
	    
    double area() {
      return length * width;
    }  
};

int main() {
  Rectangle *rect = new Rectangle(3, 4);
  cout << rect->area() << endl; // prints 12
  cout << rect->perimeter() << endl; // prints 14
}
```

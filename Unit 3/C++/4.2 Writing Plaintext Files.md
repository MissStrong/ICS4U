## Writing Plaintext Files

TODO


<!-- To read a file we need to include `<fstream>`, which stands for *file stream*. Then we can create an `ifstream` (*input file stream*) object using a plaintext file.

Here is an example for reading the words from a plaintext file called `file.txt` and printing them to the console.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream file;
  file.open("file.txt"); 
  string s;
  while (file >> s) { // reads tokens from the file until the end of the file
    cout << s << endl;
  } // the file gets closed when the ifstream object goes out of scope 
}
```

If we want to read the file one line at a time instead of one token at a time, we just need to change `file >> s` to `getline(file, s)`.

We can also open the file on the same line as we declare the file object.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ifstream file("file.txt"); // declaring the ifstream opens the file
  string s;
  while (getline(file, s)) { // reads lines from the file until the end of the file
    cout << s << endl;
  }
}
```

When using any programming language, it is good housekeeping to close any files that we opened soon after we're done using them. This helps prevents the files from getting overwritten or damaged.

However, in C++, we do not have to explicitly write `file.close();` since files are automatically closed after they are done being used.

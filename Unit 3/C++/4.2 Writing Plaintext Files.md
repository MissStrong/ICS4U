## Writing Plaintext Files

There are several classes to choose from when we are writing to files. Here's an example with the `BufferedWriter` class.

```java
/**
 * @author MissStrong
 */

// The program uses all the following classes, so they have to be imported
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
  /**
   * Creating a plaintext file and writing to it.
   *
   * @param args the command line arguments
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      FileWriter file = new FileWriter("output.txt");
      // buffer is going to keep track of what will be written to output.txt
      BufferedWriter buffer = new BufferedWriter(file);
      // this prints "Hello!" to output.txt
      buffer.write("Hello!");
      // closing buffer is necessary in order for this program to work
      buffer.close();
    } catch(IOException exception) {
      // If output.txt is not writable, information about this error gets printed to the console
      System.err.println("Error: Something went wrong when writing to the file.");
    } 
  } 
} 
```

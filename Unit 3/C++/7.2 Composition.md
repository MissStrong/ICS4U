### Composition

**Composition** is another ways in which class can be associated with other classes. It is similar to aggregation, except the subclass typically cannot exist independely of the superclass. For example, if we have a class called `BoardGame` which represents a board game, we might have a field that represents the board that are used in the game from a `Board` class.

Composition is referred to as a "owns-a" association. In the example above, a `BoardGame` owns-a `Board`. Once the board game is over, the board doesn't serve a purpose anymore.  When the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Board` object is mostly likely destroyed with it. Playing a physical board game is different, since you don't throw away the board and get a new one every time you play the game; however, this is how it typically how it works for virtual board games. If we forget to destroy all the objects we constructed, it will result in a **memory leak**!

The classes may look something like this:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Board {

  private:

    int numSpaces;

  public: 

    Board(int n) { 
      this->numSpaces = n;
    }
    
    int getNumSpaces () {
      return this->numSpaces;
    }
};

class BoardGame {

  private:

    Board *board;
    int numSpacesLeft;

  public: 

    BoardGame(Board &b) { 
      this->board = &b;
      this->numSpacesLeft = b.getNumSpaces();
    }
    
    int getNumSpacesLeft () {
      return this->numSpacesLeft;
    }

    ~BoardGame() {
      delete board;
    }

};

int main() {
  Board *b = new Board(100);
  BoardGame *game = new BoardGame(*b);
  cout << game->getNumSpacesLeft() << endl;
  delete game;
}
```

Whenever you're designing a program and are unsure whether two classes should use aggregation or composition, ask yourself whether one class "has" the other, or whether it "owns" the other.

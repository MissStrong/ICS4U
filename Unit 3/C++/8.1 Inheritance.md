### Inheritance

Inheritance is the last way in which class can be associated with other classes. Inheritance can be referred to as a "is-a" association. Unlike aggregation and composition, the subclass inherits all the fields and methods from the superclass.

Before we look at an example, we first need to understand **virtual methods** and **abstract classes**.

### Virtual Methods

A **virtual method** is a method in a superclass whose implementation is overridable. To ensure that the method does get overriden in the subclass, we can add the `virtual` keyword and append `= 0`, which is called the **pure specifier**. This will make it a **pure virtual method**.

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
   virtual double perimeter() = 0;
   virtual double area() = 0;
};
```
### Abstract Classes

**Abstract classes** are classes that contain at lease one pure virtual method. A class that is not an abstract class is a **concrete class**. 

We cannot call the constructor of an abstract classes, since they are not meant to be instantiated. Here is the example from before rewritten to include `abstract`.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

class Shape {

  public:
    virtual double perimeter() = 0; 
    virtual double area() = 0;
};

class Circle: public Shape {

  private:
    double radius;

  public:

    Circle(double r) {
      this->radius = r;
    }
   
    double perimeter() {
      return 2 * M_PI * radius;
    }
  
    double circumference() {
      return this->perimeter();
    }
    
    double area() {
      return M_PI * radius * radius;
    }  
};

class Polygon: public Shape {

  public:
    int numSides;
    vector<double*> sideLengths;

    double perimeter() {
      double p = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < numSides; i++) {
        p += *this->sideLengths[i];
      }
      return p;
    }
};

class Rectangle: public Polygon {

  private:
    double length;
    double width;
    
  public:
    Rectangle(double s1, double s2) {
      this->numSides = 4;
      this->length = max(s1, s2);
      this->width = min(s1, s2);
      this->sideLengths.push_back(&s1); 
      this->sideLengths.push_back(&s1); 
      this->sideLengths.push_back(&s2); 
      this->sideLengths.push_back(&s2); 
   }
    
    double area() {
      return this->length * this->width;
  }  
};

int main() {
  Rectangle *r = new Rectangle(3, 4);
  cout << r->area() << endl; 
  cout << r->perimeter() << endl; 
  
  Circle *c = new Circle(5);
  cout << c->area() << endl; 
  cout << c->circumference() << endl; 
}
```

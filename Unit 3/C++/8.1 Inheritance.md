### Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the last ways in which class can be associated with other classes. Inheritance can be referred to as a "is-a" association. Unlike aggregation and composition, the subclass inherits all the fields and methods from the superclass. 


Here is an example of a custom class that inherits from another custom class. 

```cpp
class Shape {

  public:
   
   double perimeter(); // the equation for perimeter will depend on the shape
   double area(); // the equation for area will depend on the shape
};

class Rectangle: public Shape {

  public:
  
    double length;
    double width;
    int numSides;
	    
    Rectangle(double side1, double side2) {
      numSides = 4;
      length = max(side1, side2);
      width = min(side1, side2);
    }
	    
    double perimeter() {
      return 2 * (length + width);
    }
	    
    double area() {
      return length * width;
    }  
};

int main() {
  Rectangle *rect = new Rectangle(3, 4);
  cout << rect->area() << endl; // prints 12
  cout << rect->perimeter() << endl; // prints 14
}
```

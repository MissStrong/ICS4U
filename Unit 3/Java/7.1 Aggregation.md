### Aggregation

**Aggregation** is one of the three ways in which class can be associated with other classes. (The other two are *composition* and *inheritance*, which we'll see later.)

Aggregation occurs when a class (called the **superclass** or **parent class**) has a field that is an object belonging to another class (called the **subclass** or the **child class**). For example, if we have a class called `BoardGame` which represents a board game, we might have a field that represents the dice that are used in the game from a `Die` class.

Aggregation is often referred to as a "has-a" association. In the example above, a `BoardGame` has-a `Die`. 

Typically, in aggregation, the subclass can exist independly of the superclass. For example, once a board game is finished, the dice could still be used in the program for other purposes. Thus, when the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Die` object isn't necessarily destroyed with it. The two classes may look something like this.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Die {

  private:
    int numSides;

  public: 

    Die(int numSides) { 
      this->numSides = numSides;
    }

    int roll() {
      srand(time(NULL));
      return rand() % this->numSides + 1;
    }
};

class BoardGame {

  private:

    vector<Die*> dice;

  public: 

    BoardGame(Die &d1, Die &d2) { 
      this->dice.push_back(&d1);
      this->dice.push_back(&d2);
    }

    int rollDice() {
      int sum = 0;
      for (Die *d : this->dice) {
        sum += d->roll();
      }
      return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
  Die *d1 = new Die(6);
  Die *d2 = new Die(6);
  BoardGame *game = new BoardGame(*d1, *d2);
  cout << game->rollDice() << endl;
  delete game; // "delete" calls the destructor (see below)
  delete d1;
  delete d2;
}
```

### Global Variables

So far we've been exclusively using **local variables** in our programs. Local can only be accessed within a non-global scope, such as within a method, a loop, or a conditional block.

To make a **global variable** we declare it within a class but outside of a method, and use the keywords **public static**.

```java

public class Main {

  public static int num = 6;
```

Now we can use and modify the global variable `num` from anywhere in our program.

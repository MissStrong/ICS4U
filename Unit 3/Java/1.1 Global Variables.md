### Global Variables

So far we've been exclusively using **local variables** in our programs. Local can only be accessed within a non-global scope, such as within a method, a loop, or a conditional block.

To make a **global variable** we declare it within a class but outside of a method, and use the keywords **public static**.

```java

public class Main {

  public static int num = 6; // can be accessed from anywhere in the program
```

Now we can use and modify the global variable `num` from anywhere in our program.

If our program has more than one class and we only want the variable ot be accessible from inside the class it's declared, in, we can use **private static** instead.

```java

public class Main {

  private static int num = 6; // can be accessed from anywhere in the class
```

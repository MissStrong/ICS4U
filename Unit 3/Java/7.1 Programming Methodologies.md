### Programming Methodologies

There are three programming methodologies: **sequential programming**, **procedural programming**, and **object-oriented programming**. 

* Sequential programming involves executing a program line-by-line, in order.
* Procedural programming involves calling functions that perform routines and can be called at any point in a program.
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that involves separating a program into separate classes.

We have been using all three methodologies in this course. OOP has the highest potential among them all when creating complex programs. 

In order to use OOP to its highest potential, it is important to understand the different ways in which a class is associated with another class. There are three types of associations: **aggregation**, **composition**, and **inheritance**.

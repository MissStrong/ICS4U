### Static Methods

A static method is a method that belongs to a class whereas a non-static method is a method that belongs to an **instance** of a class. An instance is an object that is constructed from a class's constructor. 

Static and non-static methods are used in different programming paradigms. Static methods typically perform a routine as a part of a **procedural program**, whereas non-static methods are typically used to create **object-oriented programs**. We're going to learn more about these later this unit.

We can call a static method by writing `Class.` in front of the function call (replace "Class" with the name of the class). If we don't include `Class.`, it will assume the method is inside of the class it was called from. The function names `foo()` and `bar()` are placeholder names that are commonly used in computer science.

```java
public class Main {

  public static void foo() { // static method (i.e. class method)
    System.out.println("foo");
  }
	
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main.foo(); // prints "foo"    
    foo(); // prints "foo"
  }
} 
```

Let's look at how to call a non-static method. Let's start by crearing a non-static method.

```java
public class Main {

  public void bar() { // non-static method (i.e. instance method)
    System.out.println("bar");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  }
} 
```

Now, we need to create an instance of `Main` to call it.

```java
public class Main {

  public void bar() { 
    System.out.println("bar");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main m = new Main(); // m is an instance of Main
  }
} 
```

`Main m` is declaring an instance called `m` that belongs to the `Main` class. `new Main()` is calling the constructor that will create `m`. Every class has a public constructor by default, so we don't need to create one ourselves.


```java
public class Main {

  public void bar() { 
    System.out.println("bar");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main m = new Main();
    m.bar(); // prints "bar"
    bar(); // throws error
    Main.bar(); // throws error
  }
} 
```

If we want the constructor to do something else, such as initialize some variables, we can override the default one.


```java
public class Main {

  public Main() { // constructor
    // do something here if we want
  }

  public void bar() { 
    System.out.println("bar");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main m = new Main();
    m.bar(); 
  }
} 
```

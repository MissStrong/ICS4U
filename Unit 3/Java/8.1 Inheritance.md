### Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the last ways in which class can be associated with other classes. Inheritance can be referred to as a "is-a" association. Unlike aggregation and composition, the subclass inherits all the fields and methods from the superclass. 

There are two cases:
1. The superclass is a class, and the subclass `extends` it.
2. The "superclass" is an interface, and the subclass `implements` it.

### Classes and Subclasses

All of the classes we've been working with are **subclasses** of other classes and/or interfaces.

Examples:
* `ArrayList` is a subclass of `AbstractList` which is a subclass of `AbstractCollection`, which is a subclass of `Object`
* `ArrayList` is a subclass of `List`, which is a subinterface of `Collection`, which is a subinterface of `Iterable`
* `HashMap` is a subclass of a `AbstractMap`, which is a subclass of `Object`
* `HashMap` is a subclass of a `Map`
* `Array` is a subclass of `Object`

At the very top of the class hierarchy is the `Object` class. This means every object can be declared as an `Object`!

```java
Object num = 5;
Object decimal = 3.14;
Object bool = true;
Object[] array = {1, 1.0, true, "hi"}; // sneaky workaround for an array with mixed data types
```

### Composition
Composition can be referred to as a "owns-a" association and is a strong association. It is similar to aggregation, except the subclass typically cannot exist independely of the superclass.

Expanding on the previous example, the class called `BoardGame` class may require a `Board` object. Once the board game is over, the board doesn't serve a purpose anymore.  When the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Board` object is mostly likely destroyed with it. Playing a physical board game is different, since you don't throw away the board and get a new one every time you play the game; however, this is how it typically how it works for virtual board games.  The `BoardGame` class may look something like this.

```java
public class BoardGame {

    public Die[] dice;
    public Board board;
    // ...
    
    public BoardGame(Die d1, Die d2, Board b) {
        dice = new Dice[] {d1, d2};
        board = b;
        // ...
    }
    
    // ...
    
}
```

Whenever you're designing a program and are unsure whether two classes should use aggregation or composition, ask yourself whether one class "has" the other, or whether it "owns" the other.

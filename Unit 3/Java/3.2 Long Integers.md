### Integer Overflow and Underflow

Recall that the value of an `int` can only be from `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2<sup>31</sup>) up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2<sup>31</sup>–1).
If we try to add, subtract, or multiply integers to get a result that is outside of that range, the result will seem nonsensical.

```java
System.out.println(2000000000 * 2); // prints -294967296
System.out.println(-2000000000 * 2); // prints 294967296
```

When two numbers are being added but the result exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it becomes `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and the calculation continues. Similarly, when an integer is being subtracted from another integer but the result exceeds `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, it becomes `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and the calculation continues.

```java
System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1); // prints -2147483648, which is Integer.MIN_VALUE
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1); // prints 2147483647, which is Integer.MAX_VALUE
```

### Long Integers

If we're dealing with large numbers and we don't want to worry about integer overflow and underflow, we can use `long` instead of `int`. Long integers go from `Long.MIN_VALUE` (-2<sup>63</sup>, around 9 quintillion) up to `Long.MAX_VALUE` (2<sup>63</sup>–1). 2<sup>31</sup> is approximately 2 billion whereas 2<sup>63</sup> is approximately 9 quintillion, or 9 billion billion. 

If we write out some digits, Java will automatically treat it as an `int`. To make it a `long`, we can append an `L` to the number.

```java
long n = 3000000000L; // 3 billion (higher than  Integer.MAX_VALUE)

System.out.println(2000000000L * 2); // prints 4000000000
System.out.println(-2000000000L * 2); // prints -4000000000
```

Now we only have to deal with overflow and underflow when we're working with numbers in the quintillions.

```java
System.out.println(5000000000000000000L * 2); // prints -8446744073709551616
System.out.println(-5000000000000000000L * 2); // prints 8446744073709551616
```

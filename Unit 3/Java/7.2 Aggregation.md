### Aggregation

**Aggregation** is one of the ways in which class can be associated with other classes. 

Aggregation occurs when a class (called the **superclass** or **parent class**) has a field that is an object belonging to another class (called the **subclass** or the **child class**). For example, if we have a class called `BoardGame` which represents a board game, we might have a field that represents the dice that are used in the game from a `Die` class.

Aggregation is often referred to as a "has-a" association. In the example above, a `BoardGame` has-a `Die`. 

Typically, in aggregation, the subclass can exist independly of the superclass. For example, once a board game is finished, the dice could still be used in the program for other purposes. Thus, when the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Die` object isn't necessarily destroyed with it. The two classes may look something like this.

```java
public class BoardGame {

    public Die[] dice;
    // ...
    
    public BoardGame(Die d1, Die d2) {
        dice = new Dice[] {d1, d2};
        // ...
    }
    
    // ...
    
}
```

```java
public class Die {

    public int numSides;
    // ...
    
    public Die(int numSides) {
        this.numSides = numSides;
        // ...
    }
    
    public void roll() {
       // ...
    }
    
    // ...
    
}
```

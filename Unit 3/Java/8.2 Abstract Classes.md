### Abstract Classes
**Abstract classes** are classes that contain one or more `abstract` methods. A class that is not an abstract class is a **concrete class**.

Interfaces have a few things in common with abstract classes. Neither can be instantiated and both act as a template for its subclasses. However, there are also some key differences between them. 

* Interfaces have no fields. Abstract classes may have fields.
* All methods in an interface are abstract by default (you don't need the `abstract` keyword). Not all methods in an abstract class need to be abstract.
* A subclass can inherit multiple interfaces, but at most one class.

When deciding between an abstract class and an interface in your program, consider the differences above.

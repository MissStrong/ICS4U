### Encapsulation

In order to directly access a **field** (variable or constant) in an object from outside its class, it has to be `public`. However, declaring a variable as `public` allows the user to modify its value. There are two ways to allow a user to access a field in an object from outside of the class, without allowing them to modify its value.

1. **Declare the variable as `final`.**     
This prevents the variable from being modified at all once it is initiated, making it a constant.</br></br>
The `Arrays` class uses this strategy: the `length` field is `final`, which is why you can access it using `arrayName.length`, but can't modify it.

2. **Create a method that obtains the value of the variable**.  
You can declare the variable to be `private`, then create a `public` method that returns the value of the variable.</br></br>
The `ArrayList` classes uses this strategy: it has a `private` field called `size`, but a `public` method called `size()`that returns the value of the `size` field.</br></br>
This concept of data hiding is called **encapsulation**. The "capsule" in this case would be the class.

Here is an example of encapsulation with the `Person`Â example from before.

```java
public class Person {

  private String name;
    
  public Person() {
    this.name = "unknown";
  }
    
  public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
       
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
    
  public void setName(String newName) {
    name = newName;
  }
}
```

```java
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person nancy = new Person("Nancy", "Female", 57);

		nancy.setAge(-30);
		System.out.println(nancy.getName());
		System.out.println(nancy.getGender());
		System.out.println(nancy.getAge());
	}
} 

public class Person {

	private String name;
	private String gender;
	private int age;

	public Person() {
		this.name = "";
		this.gender = "";
		this.age = -1;
	}

	public Person(String n, String g, int a) {
		this.name = n;
		this.gender = g;
		this.age = a;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public String getGender() {
		return this.gender;
	}
	
	public int getAge() {
		return this.age;
	}

	public void setName(String n) {
		this.name = n;
	}
	
	public void setGender(String g) {
		this.gender = g;
	}
	
	public void setAge(int a) {
		if (a > 0) {
			this.age = a;
		} else {
			System.err.println("Error: Cannot change age to negative number.");
		}
	}
} 
```

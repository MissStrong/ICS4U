### Encapsulation

In order to directly access a **field** (variable or constant) in an object from outside its class, it has to be `public`. However, declaring a variable as `public` allows the user to modify its value. There are two ways to allow a user to access a field in an object from outside of the class, without allowing them to modify its value.

1. **Declare the variable as `final`.**     
This prevents the variable from being modified at all once it is initiated, making it a constant.</br></br>
The `Arrays` class uses this strategy: the `length` field is `final`, which is why you can access it using `arrayName.length`, but can't modify it.

2. **Create a method that obtains the value of the variable**.  
You can declare the variable to be `private`, then create a `public` method that returns the value of the variable.</br></br>
The `ArrayList` classes uses this strategy: it has a `private` field called `size`, but a `public` method called `size()`that returns the value of the `size` field.</br></br>
This concept of data hiding is called **encapsulation**. The "capsule" in this case would be the class.

Here is an example of encapsulation with the `Person`Â example from before.

```java
public class Person {

  private String name;
    
  public Person() {
    this.name = "unknown";
  }
    
  public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
       
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
    
  public void setName(String newName) {
    name = newName;
  }
}
```

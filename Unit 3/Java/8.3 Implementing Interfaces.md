### Implementing an Interface

An interface doesn't have any fields and all its methods have empty bodies. When a subclass `implements` an interface, it must include the definitions of all the methods from the interface. We can use the keyword `@Override` to document this.

Here is an example of a custom class that implements a custom interface. 


```java
// Shapes.java

public interface Shape {    
  
  public double perimeter(); 
  public double area();
}
```

```java
// Main.java

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
  
  public final int numSides = 4;
  public final double length;
  public final double width;
    
  public Rectangle(double s1, double s2) {
    length = Math.max(s1, s2);
     width = Math.min(s1, s2);
  }
    
  @Override
  public double perimeter() {
    return 2 * (length + width);
  }
    
  @Override
  public double area() {
    return length * width;
  }  
}
```

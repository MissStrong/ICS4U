### Aggregation

**Aggregation** is one of the three ways in which class can be associated with other classes. (The other two are *composition* and *inheritance*, which we'll see later.)

Aggregation occurs when a class (called the **superclass** or **parent class**) has a field that is an object belonging to another class (called the **subclass** or the **child class**). For example, if we have a class called `BoardGame` which represents a board game, we might have a field that represents the dice that are used in the game from a `Die` class.

Aggregation is often referred to as a "has-a" association. In the example above, a `BoardGame` has-a `Die`. 

Typically, in aggregation, the subclass can exist independly of the superclass. For example, once a board game is finished, the dice could still be used in the program for other purposes. Thus, when the `BoardGame` object is destroyed, the `Die` object isn't necessarily destroyed with it. The two classes may look something like this.

```java
// Die.java

public class Die {

  public int numSides;
    
  public Die(int numSides) {
    this.numSides = numSides;
  }
  public int roll() {
    return (int)(Math.random()*numSides) + 1;
  } 
}
```

```java
// BoardGame.java

public class BoardGame {

  public Die[] dice;
  
  public BoardGame(Die d1, Die d2) {
    this.dice = new Die[] {d1, d2};
  }

  public int rollDice() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (Die d : this.dice) {
      sum += d.roll();
    }
    return sum;
  } 
}
```


```java
// Main.java

public class Main {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Die d1 = new Die(6);
    Die d2 = new Die(6);
    BoardGame game = new BoardGame(d1, d2);
    System.out.println(game.rollDice());
  }
} 
```

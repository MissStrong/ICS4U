## Bonus Assignment: Array Duplicates

Once you have completed the Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability and Array Statistics assignments, you may try the following bonus assignment.

Submit your work to the Array Duplicates Dropbox.

### Instructions
Create a method called `removeDuplicates()` that takes an array of strings and returns an array of strings that is identical to original array except it has all duplicates removed. The first occurrence of each string is kept, but all other ones are removed.

Examples:
* `removeDuplicates(["how", "now", "cow", "now", "wow"])` => `["how", "now", "cow", "wow"]`
* `removeDuplicates(["bat", "mat", "bat", "vat", "pat", "pat", "bat"])` => `["bat", "mat", "vat", "pat"]`

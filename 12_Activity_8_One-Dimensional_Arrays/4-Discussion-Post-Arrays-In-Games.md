## Arrays in Games

Array and ArrayList are some of the most useful and commonly-used data structures when creating programs in Java. 

Pick a game that you are familiar with and write about how you would use arrays and/or array lists to create a Java version of the game.

Include the following information:

* a description of the game
* what kind of arrays and/or array lists you would use
* what values you would store in the arrays and/or array lists
* how you would use the arrays and/or array lists
* how difficult it would be to create the program

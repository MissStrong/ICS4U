## Assignment: Hailstone

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Hailstone Dropbox.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70) about Collatz' Conjecture, a.k.a. the Hailstone Problem.


### Instructions

1. Create a flowchart demonstrating the Hailstone Algorithm.
2. Create a new project in NetBeans and call it "Hailstone".
    1. Create a method, called `hailstone()`, that takes one integer as a parameter, and calculates how many steps it takes for a positive integer to reach 1 using the algorithm provided in the video. If the number of steps can't be computed due to overflow, return -1. If the number is less than 1, return 0. 
    2. When the program works, zip the file and name it **Assignment 12 - \<insert your name here>.zip**.
3. Submit the following to the Dropbox:
    * Your flowchart as an .pdf file or any reasonable image filetype (e.g. .png and .jpeg).
    * A .zip file of the program.
    * A .txt file (or a .docx file or a .rtf file) containing all of the code in the .java file.
    * A self-evaluation using the rubric below. 


### Rubric

The following rubric will be used to evaluate your assignment. Each row counts for 4 points, for a total of 16 points.

### Instructions 

Create a method called `rangeSearch()` that takes a sorted array of integers and two integers, and returns a sorted sub-array (a subset of the original array) with all the integers inclusively between the two integers.  

Examples:

`int[] arrayA = {-4, -1, 5, 29, 31};`

`rangeSearch(arrayA, -1, 20)` => `{-1, 5}`    
`rangeSearch(arrayA, 6, 31)` => `{29, 31}`    
`rangeSearch(arrayA, 0, 4)` => `{}`

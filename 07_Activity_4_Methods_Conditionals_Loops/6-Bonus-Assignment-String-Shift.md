## Bonus Assignment: String Shift

Once you have completed the Shapes and Number Loops assignments, you may try the following bonus assignment.

Submit your work to the String Shift Dropbox.

### Instructions
 
Create a method called `stringShift` that takes a string `s` and an integer `n` and returns a string that is similar to `s`, except all of its characters' ASCII values are shifted forward `n` places. If `n` is negative, every character's ASCII value is shifted to backwards `Math.abs(n)` places.

Examples:
* `stringShift("hello", 2) => "jgnnq"`
* `stringShift("hello", -2) => "fcjjm"`
* `stringShift("vwxyz", 4) => "z{|}~"`

Hint: You can use casting to determine the ASCII value of a character.

## Assignment: Shapes

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Shapes Dropbox.

In this assignment, you will download a Java application and then modify the program files according to given specifications.

### Instructions 

1. Download the [Shapes](../Java_Programs/Shapes.zip) program and unzip it.
2. Load the Shapes program into NetBeans. You should see four files in the program.
3 Complete the program by filling in the lines of code using the examples as guidelines.
4. Run the new program and test it out to ensure that it works as expected.
5. When the program works, zip the file and name it Assignment 4 - <insert your name here>.zip.
6. Submit the following to the Dropbox:
  * A .zip file of the program.
  * A .txt file (or a .docx file or a .rtf file) containing all of the code in the .java file.
  * A self-evaluation using the rubric below. 

### Rubric

The following rubric will be used to evaluate your assignment. Each row counts for 4 points, for a total of 32 points.

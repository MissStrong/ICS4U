### Kruskal's Algorithm

**Kruskal's algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree by collecting edges until you have a minimum spanning tree. At each step, you collect the cheapest edge that does not create a cycle. Here is an example.

Start with the cheapest edge (CD).

```
Edges: CD
```

Find the next cheapest edge that doesn't cause a cycle.

```
Edges: CD, EF
```

Repeart the previous step until all vertices are connected.

```
Edges: CD, EF, AC
```

```
Edges: CD, EF, AC, BD
```

AB is the cheapest, but it would cause a cycle (ACDBA) so don't collect it.

```
Edges: CD, EF, AC, BD, DE
```

Here is the minimum spanning tree, which has a total cost of 10:

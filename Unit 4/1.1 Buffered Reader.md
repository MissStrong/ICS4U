So far we've been using `java.io.Scanner` for reading user input. Although it works and has simple syntax, it is not a good idea to use it when you want your program to run fast.

For contests such as the Canadian Computing Competition, it is highly recommended that you use `java.io.BufferedReader` instead. It makes use of a **buffer** (temporary storage) instead of processing each keystroke as it is typed. According to [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/tips/#java-input), `BufferedReader` is 100 times faster than `Scanner`.

You will need the following imports:

* `java.io.BufferedReader`
* `java.io.InputStreamReader`
* `java.io.IOException`
* `java.util.StringTokenizer`

All the examples below need to be in a `try` block where the `catch` block catches an `IOException`.

Here is how to read a single line.

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); // creates the reader
String line = br.readLine(); // stores the line into a string
```

Here is how to read tokens. This is faster than reading a line then using `.split()`.

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); // creates the reader
StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); // prepares the first line for tokenization
while (st.hasNextToken() {
    String token = st.nextToken(); // gets the next token from the line
    // do something with the token here
}
```

Here is how to read an integer. This is the same as reading a token, except you convert the string into an int.

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); // creates the reader
StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); // prepares the first line for tokenization
int num = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // gets the next token from the line
    // do something with the number here
}
```

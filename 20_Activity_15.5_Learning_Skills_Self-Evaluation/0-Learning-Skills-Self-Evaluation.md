## Learning Skills Self-Evaluation

Before you move on to Activity 16, please take the time to complete this [Learning Skills Self-Evaluation](https://goo.gl/forms/KCFsgnWCugWWSqAg2).Â 

You will be asked to evaluate your learning skills and set goals for the ones you want to improve on. The questions are the same as last time (Activity 4.5).

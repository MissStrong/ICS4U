### Enumerations

Recall that we can create enums like this:

```java
public enum DayOfTheWeek {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
}
```

If we want to print all the days of the week followed by its value, we can do this:

```java
for (DayOfTheWeek d : DayOfTheWeek.values() {
  System.out.println(d + ": " + d.ordinal());
}
```

Now suppose we want to pair each day of the week with some additional information. We can do that by adding a **field** for the additional information and a **constructor** that takes in the additional as a parameter. Constructors are methods that create objects (in this case, it creates an enum for each day of the week) and fields are properties that objects have. We can access fields using the notation `object.field` (replace `object` with the object and `field` with the field).


```java
public enum DayOfTheWeek {
  
  MONDAY("Alright let's get this day over with."), 
  TUESDAY("Oh good, Monday is over."),
  WEDNESDAY("Halfway through the week!"), 
  THURSDAY("It's almost Friday."), 
  FRIDAY("It's almost the weekend!"), 
  SATURDAY("Zzzzzzz."), 
  SUNDAY("Oh no, it's Monday tomorrow.");
  
  final String message; // creates a field called "message" that goes with each day of the week

  DayOfTheWeek(String s) { // this is the constructor
    this.message = s; // sets the message to the argument that was passed in (we're going to learn more about "this" later this unit)
  }
  
}
```

Now we can print the message that goes with each day of the week.

```java
for (DayOfTheWeek d : DayOfTheWeek.values()) {
  System.out.println(d + ": " + d.message);
}
```

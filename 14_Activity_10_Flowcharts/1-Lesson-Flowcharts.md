### Creating Flowcharts 

You can create flowcharts on Google Docs using the Drawing tool. Go to **Insert>Drawing**, then select the **Shapes** tool. You can drag and drop them onto the drawing area then save the drawing to place it onto the document.

You can also create flowcharts using Microsoft software (e.g. Word, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc.) using the **Shapes** tool. 

There are also many free flowchart-making software, such as [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

Drawing them by hand isn't too bad, either.

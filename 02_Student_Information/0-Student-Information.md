## Student Information

Welcome to Computer Science, Grade 12, University Preparation!

Get ready to enjoy the excitement and challenge of Computer Science in an online environment. At the end of this course, you will be well prepared for university or college Computer Science courses. Plus, you will have developed some great skills in time management, organization, and using technology as a tool.

Listed below you will find some reminders to help you to be successful.
* Check Announcements, Content, and your D2LÂ mailbox every day.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help! Post your questions in the course help forum or email me directly. When you email me, expect a return within the next 24 hours.
* Don't give up. If you are feeling lost or overwhelmed by the course, contact me immediately. Some people find that they pick up computer programming concepts easily, while others need to work harder at it.
* All students eventually "hit the wall" -- their brains feel overloaded and they just can't grasp a concept. If you feel that way, take a break and try again later. Your brain can only absorb so much new information in a session.

The key elements to success are:
* Time commitment - 1-2 hours every day.
* Communication - regular contact with me is vital!

Enjoy yourself! Remember, not all things will go perfectly if this is your first online course. There will be ups and downs, but together we can make this a success.

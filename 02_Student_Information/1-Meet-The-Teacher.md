Hello! I am Miss Strong and I am your teacher for this course. This is my first year with WRDSB and my second year of teaching overall. My teaching qualifications are in math and computer science, both of which I studied at the University of Waterloo.

My favourite programming language is Python, although I use Javascript the most often. Besides programming, my hobbies include learning foreign languages, playing video games, speedcubing, and watching anime. 

My office hours are 8:05 - 10:50 in the business office (Room 414). When I am at WCI, that is where you are most likely to find me. 

For most questions, please reach me using the email system on D2L. 

If there is an emergency, or if the D2L email system is down, you may reach me through my board email address is sarah_strong@wrdsb.ca. 

If you prefer calling, you can reach me at 519-884-9590 ext 5626. This is the business department phone number, so I might not be the one to pick up the phone, but you can ask whether I'm in the room.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What do I do if I find a link that doesn't work?*

Just contact me and state the details.

 
*I have noticed that things changed in the course during the semester. Why is this happening?*

The course was initialized with data from previous ICS 4UE courses. This included information specific to old assignments and quizzes. Many of the pages and links have been updated, but if you see a page that doesn't seem quite right, please contact me so I can update it.

 
*Why can't I get into all of the units?*

I am posting new activities for this course shortly after the previous assignment(s) is/are due. This allows you to complete this course at a consistent pace. I also modify new assignments based on feedback from previous assignments, so I try to avoid posting them prematurely. 

 
*How do I change my email address and password?*

You can change this information on your home page. On the left side of the page in the Welcome section there are links for you to use to make these changes. Don't forget to update the changes.

 
*I'm stuck. What do I do?*

Don't give up right away. When you're stuck on something, try working on it for a bit. Use Google to search a description of what you think may be wrong or search the error messages you're getting. If you still can't figure it out after a short while, take a break and come back to it later. It's common to have "aha" moments at unexpected times, such as when you're trying to fall asleep, or during a shower, or during a walk. If you've been stuck for a long time (let's say, more than 2 hours in total), post in the General Discussion Forum or send me an email. If you're at WCI, you can also visit me. If you're not at WCI, you may be able to find another mentor that you can meet with in person.

## Assignment: Jotto

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Jotto Dropbox.

Jotto is a word game in which each player has a secret five-letter word. Players take turns guessing each other's words. When a player guesses a word, the other players respond how many letters are common between the guessed word and their secret word. Players must guess real words.
 
In this assignment, you'll be creating a GUI that allows a user to play Jotto against a computer. It will be a one-player version, in which the user will be trying to guess the secret word chosen randomly by the computer.
 

### Instructions

Here is a demonstration of how it should work: [https://share.vidyard.com/watch/oeS8vax32CkzbMz5XxKcVU?](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/oeS8vax32CkzbMz5XxKcVU?).


Your GUI should have the following at minimum.
* A textbox where the user can guess a Jotto word.
* A textbox that displays the results of the words that have been guessed so far in the game.
* A label that displays how many words have been guessed so far in the game.
* A "Guess Word" button that takes the current guess and updates the interface.
* A "Give Up" button that displays the secret word.
* A "Play Again" button that starts a new game.
 
Here is a text file of all the 5-letter Jotto words that can be used in the game: [jottoWords.txt](../Java_Programs/jottoWords.txt).

This is a challenging task that combines several concepts:
* Reading from a text file that contains all the 5-letter Jotto words, and placing them into an array or array list.
* Creating a GUI.
* Creating helper methods that analyze words and support the GUI.
 
When the program works, zip the file and name it **Assignment 8 - \<insert your name here>.zip**.

Submit the following to the Dropbox:
* A .zip file of the program
* A .txt file (or .docx or .rtf file) that contains the Java code. You can do this by copy-pasting your code into a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime.
* A self-evaluation using the rubric below.

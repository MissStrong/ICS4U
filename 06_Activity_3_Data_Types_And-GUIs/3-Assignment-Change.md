##  Assignment: Change

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Change Dropbox.

In this assignment, you will download a Java application, test it, and then modify the program files according to given specifications.

### Instructions 
1. Download the [Change.zip](../Java_Programs/Change.zip) file and unzip it.
2. In NetBeans, go to **File > Open Project**, and load the Change file.
3. Read the header to see what the program does.
4. Run the program and play with the GUI.

6. Run the new program and test it out to ensure that it works as expected.
7. When the program works, go to **File > Export Project > To ZIP**. Name the file Assignment 2 - <insert your name here>.zip.
8. Submit the following to the Dropbox:
  * A .zip file of the program.
  * A .txt file that contains the Java code. You can do this by copy-pasting your code into a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime.
  * A self-evaluation using the rubric below.

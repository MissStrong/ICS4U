## Assignment: Sleep Calculator

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Sleep Calculator Dropbox.

In this assignment, you will create a Sleep Calculator application that estimates the number of hours a person has spent sleeping from the time they was born.

### Instructions

1. Create a GUI that estimates the number of hours a person has slept from the time they were born. You may use the following assumptions to simplify the calculation.
  * everyone sleeps 8 hours every night
  * there are 30 days in each month
  * there are 365 days in each year
  
  Here is an example of what your GUI may look like.

2. Run the program and test it out to ensure that it works as expected.

3. When the program works, go to File > Export Project > To ZIP. Name the file Assignment 3 - <insert your name here>.zip.

4. Submit the following to the Dropbox.
  * A .zip file of the program
  * A .txt file that contains the Java code. You can do this by copy-pasting your code into a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime.
  * A self-evaluation using the rubric below. 

### Rubric

The following rubric (which is the same as the one for the Change assignment) will be used to evaluate your assignment. Each row counts for 4 points, for a total of 32 points.

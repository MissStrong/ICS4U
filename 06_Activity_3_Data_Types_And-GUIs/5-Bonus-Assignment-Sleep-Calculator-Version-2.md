## Bonus Assignment: Sleep Calculator Version 2

Once you have completed the Change and Sleep Calculator assignments, you may try the following bonus assignment.

Submit your work to the Sleep Calculator Version 2 Dropbox.

### Instructions

This assignment is the exact same as Sleep Calculator, except for two differences:
* Don't assume that every year has 365 days and that every month has 30 days. Find the actual number of days that the person has been alive for. You may find [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Number+of+days+between+Jan+1+1980+and+Sep+25+2018) useful when you are testing your program.
* Rather than assuming that every person gets an average of 8 hours of sleep per night, assume that every person gets the average recommended number of hours per sleep based on their age group. You may find this information from the [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times/page/0/1).

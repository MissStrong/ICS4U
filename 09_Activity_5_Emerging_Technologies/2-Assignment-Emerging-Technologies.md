## Assignment: Emerging Technologies

Complete the following assignment and submit your work to the Emerging Technologies Discussion Forum and the Emerging Technologies Dropbox.

In this assignment, you will conduct research on an emerging technology of your choice. You will each choose a different topic.

 
### Instructions

1. Choose an emerging technology to research. There are plenty of suggestions on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies). Check the Discussion Forum to see whether the topic you're interested in has already been taken.
2. Send an email to Miss Strong with your topic choice *before you begin your research*. If it has not already been chosen, she will let you know and you may begin your research.
3. Consider and research the following questions:
 * What is your emerging technology and how does it work?
 * How is the technology currently being used?
 * How else can the technology be used besides its intended purpose(s)?
 * What are some of the technology's positive impacts to society?
 * What are some of the technology's negative impacts to society?
 * What do you think about the technology's future prospects?
4. Create a presentation that answers the previous questions using one of the following formats:
 * brochure/pamphlet
 * a slideshow (e.g. PowerPoint, Google Slides, Prezi, etc.)
 * an audio recording
 * a video recording
 * a live website
 * another format approved by Miss Strong
5. Create a bibliography in APA or MLA format.
6. Do a self-evaluation of your presentation using the rubric provided.
7. Submit your presentation to the Dropbox. Include:
 * your presentation file or link
 * your bibliography
 * your self-evaluation
8. Post your presentation to the Discussion Forums. Respond to at least two of your classmates' posts.

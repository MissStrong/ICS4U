## Emerging Technolgies

The world we live in and conduct business is changing daily due to advances in technology.

Because of technology, business people can now communicate with each other across the globe without leaving their respective offices.

Small local businesses have the ability to reach a global market with a simple website.

Information can be sent in an instant and important documents can be quickly downloaded.

Group meetings and training can be accomplished over the Internet through web conferencing. This type of meeting allows businesses to save money on travel costs while increasing productivity.

There is no doubt that new technologies have had a huge effect on our modern business world; however, the benefits gained from latest technological advances are not limited to just business. Emerging technology has also affected the way individuals in society live.


### Medical Technologies

Medical technology provides sophisticated equipment that is constantly improving, helping to save thousands of lives.

For example, there are special monitors and machines that allow doctors to perform intricate surgeries by displaying them on a larger monitor.

Medical technology has also helped many people manage their own care from their homes.

In addition, technology has also helped to make many aspects of life safer and easier. Lost? Simply type in your destination to a GPS. Witness a crime? Report it immediately on your cell phone. Need cash? Use an ATM.


### Digital Divide

As you can see, technology plays a role in the lives of many of the citizens of industrially developed nations. There are, however, parts of the world where technology does not play such a large role. There are places where people have limited or no access to the communication tools that we take for granted—tools such as the Internet and telephones.

The term *digital divide* refers to the gap between those who benefit from digital technology and those who do not. This term also describes the discrepancy between those who have the skills and knowledge to use the technologies and those who do not.

A digital divide can exist between those living in rural areas and those living in urban areas, between educated and uneducated persons, between economic classes, and, on the global scale, between more and less industrially developed nations.

Government and private agencies are now working towards trying to narrow the digital divide. Many believe that closing this gap will help to reduce poverty, counter the threat of terrorism, and stimulate economic growth.

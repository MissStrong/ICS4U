## GitHub

**Git** is a revision control system that allows users to review and revise source code. **GitHub** is a software development platform used to host projects that use Git. GitHub projects are called **repositories**. "Repository" is often shortened to "repo" (rhymes with "depot"). You will be GitHub it to share code between your teammates during your Culminating Task.

Every time a file in the repo is updated, it is called a **commit**. You can add a **commit message** to go with a commit to briefly explain what was changed. You can view revisions of a file side-by-side, with changed indicated in green and red, called a **diff**.

Every repo has a **master branch**, which is the current version of the project. Rather than commit to the master branch every time, it is more common to commit to other branches, then create a **pull request** (PR) to merge the branch to the master branch. That way, your code can be reviewed before it is deployed.

NetBeans supports Git. You can **push** code from NetBeans to a GitHub repo and **pull** code from a GitHub repo into Netbeans.

Go through the steps outlined in this slideshow to get familiar with GitHub. Post your GitHub username and your repo to the Discussion Forum when you are done.

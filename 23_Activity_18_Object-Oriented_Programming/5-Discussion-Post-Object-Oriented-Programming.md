## Object-Oriented Programming

OOP is a huge topic. Activity 18 introduced a lot of ideas about OOP, but didn't go into tremendous detail about each one. Now is your opportunity to choose an idea of OOP and do some independent research to learn more about it. You may research an idea introduced in Activity 18 in more detail, a different OOP idea, or what OOP looks like in another programming language. Write a 100-200 word post regarding your research.

Some suggestions include:

* comparing and contrasting abstract classes and interfaces
* comparing and contracting aggregation and composition
* comparing and contracting method overloading and method overriding
* other symbols used in UML
* singleton classes
* operator overloading
* destructors and garbage collection
* single and double underscores in Python (e.g.`__init__` and `self.__attribute`)
* virtual versus pure virtual classes in C++ and/or C#

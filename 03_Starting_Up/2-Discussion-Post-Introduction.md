## Introduction

Introduce yourself to the class. Write your name or nickname (whichever you want to be called) in the subject line. 

Your post should be 100-250 words and include the following:

* Two truths and a lie: Write two true things about you and one false thing, but don't say which one is false.
* Some things you learned in the ICS3U course.
* What you like about programming.
* What you find challenging about programming.
* What you hope to learn in this course.
* Once the discussion has been open for a few days, you may start responding to your classmates. Respond to at least two of them. 

Each of your responses should be 50-100 words. You may guess which fact about them is false and/or respond to other parts of their post. Try to respond to classmates who don't have any replies yet, or only a few replies.

## Exercise 12-1 Solutions

Download and open the [Sorting Examples](../Java_Programs/SortingExamples.zip)Â project. Play around with the GUI to see how each sorting algorithm sorts a given array. Look at the code for each sorting algorithm to see how they are implemented.

1. Find an array that takes 28 swaps for Gnome Sort, Bubble Sort, Shaker Sort, and Insertion Sort.

Any array with in decreasing order and with no duplicates work.    
E.g. `{8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`


2. Find an array that takes 7 swaps for Selection Sort, Shell Sort, and Comb Sort.

Any array that has only one cycle works.     
E.g. `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1|`(the cycle is: 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, etc.)

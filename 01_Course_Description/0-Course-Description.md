## Grade 12, University Preparation

This course enables you to further develop knowledge and skills in computer science. You will use modular design principles to create complex and fully documented programs, according to industry standards. You will work in teams and manage a large software development project, from planning through to project review. You will also analyze algorithms for effectiveness. You will investigate ethical issues in computing and further explore environmental issues, emerging technologies, areas of research in computer science, and careers in the field.

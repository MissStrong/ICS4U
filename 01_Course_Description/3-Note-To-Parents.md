## Note To Parents

### Welcome

Online education may be a new experience for everyone. It is an exciting way to present information to students and offers several benefits:

* Students are better prepared for the independent learning environment at university and/or college.
* Students develop time management and organizational skills.
* Students get the opportunity to take a course that may not be offered at their home school, or that will not fit into their timetable.
* Students are able to go through activities as often as they wish because the course material is always available.

### Course Material

This course is made up of four units. Each unit contains a set of activities and assignments. At the end of the course, students will complete a summative evaluation which may include a "face-to-face" component at the student's home school.

### Time

Students have some flexibility with scheduling the time they spend on- and off-line. The teacher will set due dates for assessments. The student is responsible to meet those deadlines.

Regular attendance in the course makes the difference between success and failure. We suggest a time commitment of one to two hours daily.

### Thank You!

Thank you for taking an interest in your child's education. Parental involvement increases the chances of your child doing well in school and in this course. Encourage your child to work on this course daily.

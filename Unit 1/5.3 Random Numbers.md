### Random Numbers

The `Math` class has a method called `random()` that generates a random double decimal number from in [0, 1), i.e. 0 to 0.9999999999999999 (fifteen 9s).

If we want a random number between 0 and some positive number, we can multiple `Math.random()` with the highest possible number. 

```java
int low = 0;
int high = 50;

double randomNumber = Math.random() * high; // random decimal number from 0 to 49.999...
```

If we want a random number between two specific numbers, we can multiply `Math.random()` with the distance between the two numbers, then add the lower of the two numbers.

```
int low = 10;
int high = 60;

double randomNumber = Math.random() * (high - low) + low; // random decimal number from 10 to 59.999...
```

If we want only integer results, we can cast the `double` to an `int`, which will truncate the number.

```
int low = 10;
int high = 60;

int randomNumber = (int)(Math.random() * (high - low) + low); // random integer from 10 to 59
```

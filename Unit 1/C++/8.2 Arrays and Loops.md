### Arrays and Loops

A **standard `for` loop** can be used to iterate through an array by looking at each element one by one.

It would look something like this:

```cpp
int arrayLength = sizeof(arrayName)/sizeof(arrayName[0]);

for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    // do something with arrayName[i]
}
```

The `sizeof()` function determines how many bytes a variable takes up. By taking the total number of bytes and dividing it by the number of bytes the first element takes up (all elements take up the same since they're the same data type), we can calculate how many elements there are altogether in the array.

In C++, the index of the first element of every array is 0. In the first iteration, `i` is 0; in the second iteration, `i` is 1; in the third iteration, `i` is 2; and so on until `i` is the last index of the array.

The last index is `arrayNameLength - 1` since the first index is 0, which is why `<` is used in the condition instead of `<=`.  Alternatively, we could write `i <= arrayLength - 1` as the condition, but it's not as nice looking as `i < arrayLength`.

Here's an example with the cast members of the Office:

```cpp
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};

for (int i = 0; i < officeCast.length; i++) {
  cout << i << ": " << officeCast[i] << endl;
}
```

### Printing Arrays

If we print an array using `cout << arrayName << endl;` it will print a hexadecimal value, which indicates the array's address in memory.

In order to print the contents of the array, we can use a loop to print each item

```cpp
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};

int officeLength = 14;
	
for (int i = 0; i < officeLength; i++) {
  cout << i << ": " << officeCast[i] << endl;
}
```

### Sorting Arrays

If we want to sort the values in an array, we can the `sort()` function in the `algorithms` header file. The `sort()` function takes the beginning and ending addresses of the array and a comparison function that we can make ourselves.

```cpp
/**
 * Compares two strings a and b
 *
 * @return true if a comes before b and false otherwise
 */
bool compare(string a, string b) {
    return a < b;
}
```

We can get the address of any variable by prepending an ampersand `&`. Here's the cast of The Office in alphabetical order.

```cpp
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};

int officeLength = 14;

sort(&officeCast[0], &officeCast[officeLength-1], compare); // compare() is in the previous codeblock
	
for (int i = 0; i < officeLength; i++) {
  cout << i << ": " << officeCast[i] << endl;
}
```
 
If we want it in reverse alphabetical order, we can define `compare()` to be `a>b` instead of `a<b`.

### User Input

In order to use the console to get user input, we need to use the `cin` identifier, pronounced "C in" and the ">>" operator, read as "get from". We also need to indicate what data type we want to store the input in.

Here's an example of getting an integer from user input:

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n; // stores the input in n
```

`cin` is from the `std` namespace, so if we didn't have `using namespace std;` we would need to write `std::cin` instead.

To make it clear what we want them to write, we can write a prompt for them.

```cpp
int n;
cout << "Enter an integer: ";
cin >> n; // stores the input in n
cout << "Your integer was: " << n << endl;
```

If the user enters anything other than an integer, the value of `n` will default to 0.

If we want to store user input as a string instead, we need to include make the variable a string. 

```cpp
string name;
cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin >> name; // stores the name
cout << "Hello " << name <<  "!" << endl; // says "Hello" to the user
```

If we want to use a C function such as `printf`, we need to make `name` a character array instead of a string.

```cpp
char name[100]; // we need a character array instead of a string since printf is a C function
cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin >> name; // stores the name
printf("Hello %s!\n", name); // says "Hello" to the user
```

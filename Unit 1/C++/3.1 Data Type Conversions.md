### Data Type Conversion

A **type conversion** occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different but compatible type. There are two kinds of type conversion: explicit and implicit.

We can use **explicit conversion** (a.k.a. **casting**) by treating a variable of one data type as if it belongs to a different, yet similar, data type. 

Here are some examples of methods used for casting:

```cpp
int num = stoi("6"); // this changes the string "6" into the integer 6
string total = to_string(6); // this changes the integer 6 into the string "6"
```

When we are converting from a numeric data type to another, we can put the data type name in brackets in front of the value to cast it.

```cpp
int n = (int)6.1; // this changes the double 6.1 into the integer 6
float f = -9.35
double d = (double)f; // this changes the flaot 4.5 into the double 4.7
```

The other kind of type conversion is **implicit conversion** (a.k.a. **coercion**). This is done automatically by C++ when a program is running.

Here are some examples of coercion:

```cpp
int n = true; // n is initialized to 1
```

```cpp
int n = 2.1; // n is initialized to 2, not 2.1 
```

```cpp
int n = 6;
double d = 7.3;
double d = n + d;  // 6 is an int, but it is converted to the double 6 before it gets added to 7.3
```

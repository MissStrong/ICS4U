### Do While Loops

A *while loop* checks the condition before running the block of code. If we want the condition to be checked after the block of code is run once, we can use a *do while loop*. 

Here is the general structure of a *do while loop*.

```cpp
do {
    <statement>;
    â‹®
    <statement>;
} while (<condition>);
```

Here's an example where we want the user to enter a integer from 1 to 10, and if they don't do that it will keep asking them.

```cpp
int num;
	
do {
  cout << "Enter an integer from 1 to 10: ";
  cin >> num;
  if (num > 10) {
    cout << "Too high!" << endl;
  } else if (num < 1) {
    cout << "Too low!" << endl;
  } 
} while (num < 1 || num > 10);

cout << "Thanks!" << endl;
```

The declaration `int num;` must be before `do` so that the condition in the while loop does not have an out-of-scope variable.

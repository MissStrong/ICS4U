### Switch Statements

Switch statements are conditional structures that are sometimes convenient to use when the condition involves checking equality.

These two pieces of code accomplish essentially the same thing. 

**If Statement**

```cpp
if (letter == 'y') {
  cout << "Sneaky..." << endl;
  cout << "Thanks!" << endl;
} else if (letter == 'a' || letter == 'e' || letter == 'i' || letter == 'o' || letter == 'u') {
  cout << "Thanks!" << endl;
} else if (letter == 'A' || letter == 'E' || letter == 'I' || letter == 'O' || letter == 'U' || letter == 'Y') {
  cout << "That's an uppercase vowel..." << endl;
} else {
  cout << "That's not a vowel..." << endl;
}
```

**Switch Statement**

```cpp
char letter;
cout << "Enter a lowercase vowel: ";
cin >> letter;

switch (letter) {
  case 'y':
    cout << "Sneaky..." << endl;
  case 'a':
  case 'e':
  case 'i':
  case 'o':
  case 'u':
    cout << "Thanks!" << endl;
    break;
  case 'A':
  case 'E':
  case 'I':
  case 'O':
  case 'U':
  case 'Y':
    cout << "That's an uppercase vowel..." << endl;
    break;
  default:
    cout << "That's not a vowel..." << endl;
    break;
}
```

Notice how we don't need curly braces for each `case` in the *switch* example. This is because the entire *switch* block is run until it reaches a `break` or the end of the *switch* structure. We'll be seeing another use of the keyword `break` in loops later on.

It is convention to put `default` and the bottom after all the cases, since it gets reads last anyway.

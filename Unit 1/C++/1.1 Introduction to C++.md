### Introduction to C++

C++ is a programming language similar to Java and C. It is known for being a *fast* and *efficient* language.

C++ has a moderate learning curve. At first, it can be challenging to learn and some of its limitations can be frustrating; however, once we have become accustomed to the programming in C++, it allows us to be highly productive and create complex programs.

C++ has consistently been in the top five most popular programming langauges over the past two decades. Other languages that have been consistently popular include Python, C, Java, and JavaScript.

### C++ Code

Here is an example of the classic "Hello World" program, in which `Hello World` is printed to the screen.

Here are some things worth noting now.

#### 1. Comments

Comments are used to write words in our program to help explain what is going on. There are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line. 

* **Multi-line comments** take up multiple lines of code. They start with `/*` or `/**` and end with `*/` (the `*` at the beginning of each line in between is optional). 

* **Single-line comments** take up only one line of code or one partial line of code. They start with `//`. These types of comments are typically used to provide a brief decription of what's going on in a particular line of code.

Multi-line comments that begin with `/**` can include **tags**, which begin with a `@`. There are two examples of tags in the above image: 

* Line 2: The `@author` tag, which shows who wrote the program.
* Line 11: The `@return` tag, which describes what a function returns when it is run.

#### 2. Functions

Every C++ program should contain a `main()` function. The content of a `main()` function is run when we run our program. In C++, the `main()` function must return an `int` value. It automatically returns 0 if ran successfully, and 1 if it ran unsuccessfully.

When defining a function, we would write the following, in order:

1. the return type (e.g. `int`, `string`, etc.) (or write `void` if the function doesn't return anything)
4. the name of the function
5. the parameters of the function enclosed in parentheses
6. a left curly brace `{`
7. the body of the function
8. a right curly brace `}`

When we are talking about a function such as `main()`, we can append `()` at the end of its name to make it clear that it is a function, not a variable.

### 3. Header Files

In order to create C++ programs with a lot of functionality, we're going to need to include **header files**, which are files that declaration built-in variables, constants, and functions. For example, in order to print something to the console, we should include the `iostream` (**i**nput-**o**utput **stream**) file. The syntax for importing a header file is `#include <filename>`.

### 4. Namespace

Whenever we use a **namespace**, we are declaring a specific scope to variables and functions. The identifiers `cout` and `endl` belong to the `std` (**st**andar**d**) namespace and if we didn't have the line `using namespace std;`, we would need to write `std::cout` and `std::endl` instead of just `cout` and `endl`.

### Writing C++ Code Using Replit

In this course, we will be using [Replit](http://replit.com) to write C++ code. Replit is a web-based programming environment. It is not the best programming environment, however we are using it since it can be used on your Chromebooks as does not require you to download any software.

Here are a few things worth noting about writing C++ code in Replit that are different than other programming environments:

* The main filename is called `main.cpp` and we cannot change its name.
* The `main()` function must be inside the `main.cpp` file.

### String Formatting

Suppose we want to print the date and we have variables for the month, day, and year.

One of the ways we could do that is print each part of the date with spacing between them. If we don't want a space immediately

```cpp
string month = "March";
int day = 14;
int year = 2015;

cout << month << " " << day << ", " << year << endl; 
```

Although this works, it's difficult to read at a glance and easy to make spacing mistakes.

An alternative is to use **string formatting**. String formatting involves using placeholders that get filled in with values of variables. Placeholders begin with `%`. The placeholder for a string is `%s` and the placeholder for an integer is `%d` (the "d" stands for *decimal integer*).

If we want to create a string variable , we need to include the `string` header file. Strings in C++ are actually character arrays in disguise and the header file lets us forget about that and just pretend they're regular strings.

However, for printing formatted strings, we need to use the  `printf()` instead of `cout`. The "f" stands for formatting. The `printf()` function is a part of the C language, which has character arrays instead of strings. We also need to include `cstdlib` to get access to `printf()`.

```cpp
char month[] = "March";
int day = 14;
int year = 2015;

printf("%s %d, %d\n", month, day, year); 
```

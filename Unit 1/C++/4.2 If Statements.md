### If Statements

Here is the general structure of an *if* statement.

```java
if (<condition>) {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
} else if (<condition>) {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
} else {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
}
```

The keywords `if`, `else if`, and `else` work like this:
* The `if` block runs only if the condition is `true`. 
* Any `else if` blocks run only if all the previous conditions in the conditional structure are `false` (the "else" in `else if`) and the new condition is true (the "if" in else if).
* The `else` block runs only if all the previous conditions in the conditional structure are `false`.

In any conditional structure, we may have as many or as few `else if` blocks as we wish. We may have no more than one `else` block. 

In general, if the conditions are mutually exclusive (i.e. they can't hold true at the same time), we should use `if` followed by `else if` rather than `if` followed by another `if`.

```cpp
int num;
cout << "Enter an integer from 1 to 10: ";
cin >> num;

if (num > 10) {
  cout << "Too high!" << endl;
} else if (num < 1) {
  cout << "Too low!" << endl;
} else {
  cout << "Thanks!" << endl;
}
```

If there is only one statement in a block, we may remove the curly braces and move the statement up one line.

For example, the following two pieces of code perform essentially the same thing.

```cpp
if (y < 10) {
    y++;
}
```

```cpp
if (y < 10) y++;
```

### Nested Loops

A loop that is placed inside another loop is called a **nested loop**.

Here is an example of a nested loop.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 9; j++) {
      cout << "i, j: " << i << ", " << j << endl;
    }
}
```

In this example, the for loop that iterates on `i` would be referred to as the **outer loop**, and the for loop that iterates on `j` would be referred to as the **inner loop**.

If we have a loop inside of a loop, which is already inside another loop, there would be two levels of inner loops.

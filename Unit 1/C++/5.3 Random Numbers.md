### rand()

The `std` namespace has a function `rand()` that generates a pseudo-random positive integer from 0 to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1.

The catch is that we need to first select a random **seed**. Pseudo-random number generators use seeds to influence the random number. If we keep picking the same seed, we'll keep getting the same random number.

The function `srand()` is used to change the seed. To pick a seed, we can use the timestamp of when we run our program. The `time()` function is in `cstdlib` header file (C standard library) and for now we can just use `NULL` as the argument. We'll learn more about `NULL` later.

```cpp
srand(time(NULL));
cout << rand() << endl;
```

If we want a random number between 0 and some positive number, we can use the modulo operator to confine the possible results. 

```java
int low = 0;
int high = 50 + 1; // the +1 ensures that it goes up to 50, not 49

srand(time(NULL));
cout << rand() % high << endl; // random integer from 0 to 50
```

If we want a random number between two specific numbers, we can ensure the range has the correct number of possible results, then add the lowest possible number to it.

```java
int low = 10;
int high = 60 + 1;

srand(time(NULL));
cout << rand() % (high - low) + low << endl; // random integer number from 10 to 60
```

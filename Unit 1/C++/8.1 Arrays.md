### Arrays vs. Lists

Depending on what programming language you used in your Grade 11 computer science course, you would have either learned about **arrays**, **lists**, or both.

Arrays and lists are both data structures that store ordered sets of values, but there are a few major differences between them:

* arrays have fixed lengths; lists are dynamic in length
* arrays could be immutable; lists are always mutable
* arrays tend to have values of one data type; lists tend to allow values of more than one data type

Here is a summary of what lists and arrays are called in various languages.

| Language   | List        | Array                         |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| C          | linked list | array                         |
| Turing     | linked list | array                         |
| C++        | list        | array                         |
| C#         | list        | array                         |
| Python     | list        | tuple (pronounced "too-pull") |
| JavaScript | array list  | array                         |
| Java       | array list  | array                         |

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

There are two common ways to initialize arrays.

1. Declare and initialize the array on the same line.
   Here is an example.

```java
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};
```

2. Declare the array, then fill the elements one by one.
   Here is an example.

```java
string officeCast[14];
officeCast[0] = "Michael";
officeCast[1] = "Dwight";
â‹®
officeCast[13] = "Toby";
```

In the first example:

* `string ...[]` indicates that every element in the array will be a string
* `officeCast` is the name of the array
* the fourteen elements of the array are `"Michael"`, `"Dwight"`, ..., and `"Toby"`

In the second example:

* `string ...[...]` indicates that every element in the array will be a string
* [14] indicates that there will be fourteen elements in the array (by default they are all the empty string)
* `officeCast` is the name of the array
* `officeCast[...] = ...;` initializes the element at that index (starting at 0) to be that value

### Accessing Array Elements

To access an element in an array at index `i`, we can use `arrayName[i];`.

```cpp
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};

cout << officeCast[5] << endl; // prints Phyllis
```

### Modifying Array Elements

The notation for modifying individual elements is the same as accessing values.

```cpp
string officeCast[] = {"Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Stanley", "Phyllis", "Meredith", "Creed", "Kevin", "Oscar", "Angela", "Ryan", "Kelly", "Toby"};

officeCast[11] = "Gabe"; // changes the string at index 11 to "Gabe"

cout << officeCast[11] << endl; // prints "Gabe" instead of "Ryan"
```

### Special Characters

Strings are made up of characters, which are typically letters, numbers, and spaces. There are also special characters, such as tabspace and newline that can appear in strings.

Special characters begin with a backslash `\`.

| Special Character                      | Code |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| tabspace                               | `\t` |
| backspace                              | `\b` |
| carriage return (i.e. enter or return) | `\r` |
| newline                                | `\n` |

Here is an example of how we can use a special character.

```cpp
// Prints "This is Line 1" on the one line, then "This is Line 2" on the next line
cout << "This is Line 1\nThis is Line 2\n";
```

However, it's preferable to do one of the following instead.

```cpp
cout << "This is Line 1" << endl << "This is Line 2" << endl;
```

or

```cpp
cout << "This is Line 1" << endl;
cout << "This is Line 2" << endl;
```

The backslash is called an **escape character**, since it "escapes" the next character.

We can also use the escape character to create strings that contain double quotation marks and characters that contain a single quotation mark. We cannot use single quotation marks for strings in Java; they are only for individual characters.

```cpp
cout << "\"" << endl; // Prints a double quotation mark
cout << "\"\"" << endl; // Prints two double quotation marks
cout << '\'' << endl; // Prints a double quotation mark
```

To create a string with a backslash, we put an escape character in front of it.

```java
cout << "\\" << endl; // Prints a backslash
```

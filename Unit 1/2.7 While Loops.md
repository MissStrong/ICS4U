## While Loops

A **loop** is a structure that repeatedly executes a specified block of code. This process of repetition is called **iteration**. 

If we want to repeat specific lines of code a specific number of times, or until a specific condition is met, we can use a loop to accomplish that.

### While Loops

We would generally use a *while loop* when we know how to tell when the block of code should stop being running repeatedly.

Here is the general structure of a *while loop*.

```java
while (<condition>) {
    <statement>;
    â‹®
    <statement>;
}
```

A *while loop* does the following.

1. Checks to see whether the condition is met. If it isn't met, the block does not run.
2. If the condition is met, it runs the block of code (the content within the curly braces).
3. Repeats steps 1-2 repeatedly until the condition is no longer met in step 1.

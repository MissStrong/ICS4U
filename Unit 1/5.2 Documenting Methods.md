### Documenting Methods

We may have been wondering what these recurring lines of code are for:

```java
/**
 * @param args the command line arguments
 */
```

This is the documentation for the `main()` method. It is placed directly above the first line of the `main()` method. It tells the user that `main()` is a method that has one parameter, called `args`, and it represents the command line arguments. 

When we create our own methods, we should document them, too.

```java
/**
 * Takes the length and width of a rectangle and returns the rectangle's area.
 * @param l the length of the rectangle
 * @param w the width of the rectangle
 * @return the area of the rectangle
 */
```
When we are documenting a method, the following information should be stated:
* A brief description of what the method is for.
* The parameter names and what conditions they have (e.g. can be any integer, must be an integer greater than 2, etc.).
* What the method returns, unless nothing is returned.
* Any side effects of the method (e.g. static variables changing values, information printed to the output window, etc.).

```java
/**
 * Takes the side lengths of a triangle and returns the triangle's perimeter.
 * @param a the first side length of the triangle
 * @param b the second side length of the triangle
 * @param c the third side length of the triangle
 * @return the perimeter of the triangle
 */ 
public static double perimeter(double a, double b, double c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```
We can call the method above from `main()`.

```java
public static void main() {
  System.out.println(perimeter(4, 2.6, 8.1)); // prints 14.7
}
```

If we don't want a method to be called from a class other than the one it is in, we can use the modifier `private` instead of `public` when we're defining the method.

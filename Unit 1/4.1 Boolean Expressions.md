## Boolean Expressions

A `boolean` is one of the eight primitive data types in Java. Like all primitive data types, it is written in all lowercase letters.

A **Boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. We can create Boolean expressions using **comparison operators**, **equality operators**, and **Boolean operators**.

Here are all the operators we can use in Java to create Boolean expressions.

| Operator Name | Operator Symbol | Category | Example | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Less Than | `<` | Comparison Operator | `3 < 5 // true` | 3 is less than 5, so the expression is `true`. |
| Greater Than | `>` | Comparison Operator | `3 > 5 // false` | 3 is not greater than 5, so the expression is `false`. |
| Less Than or Equal To | `<=` | Comparison Operator | `3 <= 5 // true`	| 3 is less than or equal to 5, so the expression is `true`.<br></br> `<=` is supposed to look like the ≤ symbol. |
| Greater Than or Equal To | `>=` | Comparison Operator | `3 >= 5 // false`	| 3 is neither greater than nor equal to 5, so the expression is false. </br></br>`>=` is supposed to look like the ≥ symbol. |
| Equals | `==` | Equality Operator | `3 == 5 // false`	| 3 is not equal to 5, so the expression is false.<br/></br>Mixing up `=` and `==` is a notorious error in computer science. This applies to many programming languages, not just Java. |
| Not Equals | `!=` | Equality Operator | `3 != 5 // true`	| 3 is not equal to 5, so the expression is `true`.<br/></br>The exclamation point is commonly used to negate operators (i.e. make them the negative of what they originally are). |
| NOT | `!` | Boolean Operator | `!(3 < 5) // false`	| The statement in the parentheses is `true`, so the expression is the negation of that, which is `false`. |
| AND | `&&` | Boolean Operator | `(3 < 5) && (3 > 5) // false`	| At least one of those two statements is `false`, so the expression is `false`.<br/></br>There is a similar operator, `&`, called a bitwise operator, which does something completely different. Look it up if you're interested. |
| OR | `\|\|` | Boolean Operator | `(3 < 5) \|\| (3 > 5) // true`	| At least one of those two statements is `true`, so the expression is `true`.<br></br>There is a similar operator, `|`, called a bitwise operator, which does something completely different. Look it up if you're interested.<br/></br>The pipe character is typically found above or beside the ENTER key. |
| XOR | `^` | Boolean Operator | `(3 < 5) ^ (3 > 5) // true`	| Exactly one of those two statements is `true`, so the expression is `true`.<br/></br>XOR is called "exclusive OR". It's like OR, except it returns `false` when more than one statement is `true`.<br/></br>The `^` symbol is called a "caret", not to be confused with "carrot" or "carat". |

The convention to write the names of Boolean Operators in all capital letters. That's why NOT, AND, OR, and XOR are in all capital letters.

The comparison operators can also be used with `char` values.  It compares them based on character order (which is sort of like alphabetical order, except it compares the ASCII values). The comparison operators cannot be used for `String` values.

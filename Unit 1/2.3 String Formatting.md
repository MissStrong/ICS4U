### String Formatting

Suppose we want to print the date and we have variables for the month, day, and year.

One of the ways we could do that is to concatenate several strings together using the `+` operator. The integers get coerced into becoming strings when we use the `+` operater with a string and an int.

```java
String month = "March";
int day = 14;
int year = 2015;

System.out.println(month + " " + day + ", " + year); 
```

Although this works, it's difficult to read at a glance and easy to make spacing mistakes.

A better alternative is to use **string formatting**. String formatting involves using placeholders that get filled in with values of variables. Placeholders begin with `%`.

| placeholder | data type |
| --- | --- |
| `%s` | string |
| `%d` | integer |
| `%f` | decimal number |

When we're printing, we can use `System.out.printf()`, where the "f" stands for *formatting*. This method takes a formatted string, followed by the variables that get filled in. 

```java
String month = "March";
int day = 14;
int year = 2015;

System.out.printf("%s %d, %d\n", month, day, year); 
```

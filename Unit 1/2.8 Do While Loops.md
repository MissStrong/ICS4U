### Do While Loops

A *while loop* checks the condition before running the block of code. If we want the condition to be checked after the block of code is run once, we can use a *do while loop*. 

Here is the general structure of a *do while loop*.

```java
do {
    <statement>;
    â‹®
    <statement>;
} while (<condition>);
```

### Break and Continue

At any point in a loop, we can use the keyword `break` to get out of the loop. The keyword `break` is somewhat controversial in computer science since some programmers consider it bad form. I am not one of them. We may use it in this course.

The keyword `continue` is slightly less controversial, but again, I am okay with you using it in this course. When a loop is run and it reaches a `continue`, it skips to the end of the current iteration.

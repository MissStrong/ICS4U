### If Statements

Here is the general structure of an *if* statement.

```java
if (<condition>) {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
} else if (<condition>) {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
} else {
    <statement>;
    ⋮
    <statement>;
}
```

The keywords `if`, `else if`, and `else` work like this:
* The `if` block runs only if the condition is `true`. 
* Any `else if` blocks run only if all the previous conditions in the conditional structure are `false` (the "else" in `else if`) and the new condition is true (the "if" in else if).
* The `else` block runs only if all the previous conditions in the conditional structure are `false`.

In any conditional structure, we may have as many or as few `else if` blocks as we wish. We may have no more than one `else` block. 

In general, if the conditions are mutually exclusive (i.e. they can't hold true at the same time), we should use `if` followed by `else if` rather than `if` followed by another `if`.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter an integer from 1 to 10: ");
int num = scanner.nextInt();  

if (num > 10) {
    System.out.println("Too high!");
} else if (num < 1) {
    System.out.println("Too low!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Thanks!");
}
```

If there is only one statement in a block, we could remove the curly braces and move the statement up one line.

For example, the following two pieces of code perform essentially the same thing.

```java
if (y < 10) {
    y++;
}
```

```java
if (y < 10) y++;
```

For the sake of readabilty, this is only recommended when the block is **very short**.

## User Input

In order to use the console to get user input, we need to import the `Scanner` class, which is located in the `java.util` package. 

To import a class, we use the `import` keyword.

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // imports the Scanner class
```

Now we can make a `Scanner` object. The `Scanner()` method takes an argument indicating where to scan from. Since we're using the console, it will be `System.in`. Once we make the object, we can call its methods. To collect one line of user input at a time, we can use `.nextLine()` every time we want the user to enter onen line.

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // creates a scanner object
    String input = scanner.nextLine();  // waits for the user to enter a line
  }
}
```

To make it clear what we want them to write, we can write a prompt for them.

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
    System.out.print("What's your name? ");
    String name = scanner.nextLine();
  }
}
```

Now the user input will be stored in a variable and we can respond to it.


```java
/**
 * @author MissStrong
 */
 
import java.util.Scanner;  // imports the Scanner class

public class Main {  
  /**
   * Asks the user for their name and says "Hello" to them.
   *
   * @param args the command line arguments
   * @return void
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  // creates a Scanner object
    System.out.print("What's your name? "); // prompts the user to enter their name

    String name = scanner.nextLine();  // reads one line of user input
    System.out.printf("Hello, %s!", name);  // says "Hello" to the user
  }
}
```

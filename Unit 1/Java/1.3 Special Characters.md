### Special Characters

Strings are made up of characters, which are typically letters, numbers, and spaces. There are also special characters, such as tabspace and newline that can appear in strings.

Special characters begin with a backslash `\`.

| Special Character                      | Code |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| tabspace                               | `\t` |
| backspace                              | `\b` |
| carriage return (i.e. enter or return) | `\r` |
| newline                                | `\n` |


The backslash is called an **escape character**, since it "escapes" the next character.

Here is an example of how we can use a special character.

```java
// Prints "This is Line 1" on the one line, then "This is Line 2" on the next line
System.out.println("This is Line 1\nThis is Line 2");
```

However, ``println()`` is designed to print one line at a time, so it is preferable to do the following instead.

```java
System.out.println("This is Line 1");
System.out.println("This is Line 2");
```

We can also use the escape character to create strings that contain double quotation marks and characters that contain a single quotation mark. We cannot use single quotation marks for strings in Java; they are only for individual characters.

```java
System.out.println("\""); // Prints a double quotation mark
System.out.println("\"\""); // Prints two double quotation marks
System.out.println('\''); // Prints a single quotation mark
```

To create a string with a backslash, we put an escape character in front of it.

```java
System.out.println("\\"); // Prints a backslash
```

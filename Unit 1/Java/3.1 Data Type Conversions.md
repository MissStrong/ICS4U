### Data Type Conversion

A **type conversion** occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different but compatible type. There are two kinds of type conversion: explicit and implicit.

We can use **explicit conversion** (a.k.a. **casting**) by treating a variable of one data type as if it belongs to a different, yet similar, data type. 

Here are some examples of methods used for casting:

```java
int num = Integer.parseInt("6"); // this changes the string "6" into the integer 6
String total = Integer.toString(6); // this changes the integer 6 into the string "6"
```

When we are converting from a numeric data type to another, we can put the data type name in brackets in front of the value to cast it.

```java
int num = (int)6.0; // this changes the double 6.0 into the integer 6
long num = (long)6; // this changes the int 6.0 into the long 6
```

The other kind of type conversion is **implicit conversion** (a.k.a. **coercion**). This is done automatically by Java when a program is running.

Here are some examples of coercion:

```java
double d = 4;  // 4 is an int/long, but it is converted to the double 4.0
String s = "a" + 10;  // 10 is converted to the string "10"
```

### Mathematical Operators

Java has the following built-in mathematical operators. We can use them to manipulate and calculate numeric values.

| Operator | Example              | New Value of `score`                                         |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `=`      | `score = 10;`        | Assigns 10 to the value of `score`. This only works when `score` has already been declared. |
| `+`      | `score = score + 2;` | Adds 2 to the value of `score`.                              |
| `-`      | `score = score - 5;` | Subtracts 5 from the value of `score`.                       |
| `*`      | `score = score * 2;` | Multiplies the value of `score` by 2.                        |
| `/`      | `score = score / 5`  | Divides the value of `score` by 5 then takes the dividend.   |
| `%`      | `score = score % 5;` | Divides the value of `score` by 5 then takes the remainder.  |
| `+=`     | `score += 7;`        | Adds 7 to the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score + 7;`. |
| `-=`     | `score -= 2;`        | Subtracts 2 from the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score - 2;`. |
| `*=`     | `score *= 2;`        | Multiplies the value of `score` by 2<br><br/> Essentially equivalent to `score = score * 2;`. |
| `/=`     | `score /= 2;`        | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the dividend.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score / 2`;. |
| `/%`     | `score %= 2;`        | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the remainder.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score % 2;.` |
| `++`     | `score++;`           | Adds 1 to the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score + 1;` and `score += 1;`. |
| `--`     | `score--;`           | Subtracts 1 from the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score - 1;` and `score -= 1;`. |

For other mathematical operations, we would need to use built-in methods from a class called `Math`. 

### Java API

The [Java Application Program Interface (API)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/) is a collection of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces. We can use it to find out what packages, classes, and interfaces exist and how we can use them when we are writing code in Java.

For example, under **All Classes**, we can find **Math**. Under **Methods Summary**, we can see all its built-in methods. One of the methods is `pow(double a, double b)`. This tells that if we want to evaluate 2<sup>3</sup>, we would use `Math.pow(2, 3)`. (This is an example of coercion, since 2 and 3 are actually integers, not doubles.)

Let's look at some more of the built-in methods in `Math`.
* `Math.max()` compares two values and returns the largest value.
* `Math.min()` compares two numbers and returns the smallest.
* `Math.pow()` computes and returns the first value to the power of the second value.
* `Math.sqrt()` computes and returns the square root of a specific number.
* `Math.abs()` finds the absolute value of a number.
* `Math.ceil()` computes and returns the smallest integer greater than, or equal to, the number.
* `Math.floor()` computes and returns the largest integer less than, or equal to, the number.
* `Math.round()` rounds a value up or down to the nearest integer and returns the value.

Just like when we created a custom method and called it from a different file, the class name goes before the method name and is separated by a dot.

The `Math` class is imported by default, so we don't need an `import` statement for it.

### Math.random()

The `Math` class has a method called `random()` that generates a pseudo-random double decimal number from in [0, 1), i.e. 0 to 0.9999999999999999 (fifteen 9s).

If we want a random number between 0 and some positive number, we can multiply `Math.random()` with the highest possible number. 

```java
int low = 0;
int high = 50;

double randomNumber = Math.random() * high; // random decimal number from 0 to 49.999...
```

If we want a random number between two specific numbers, we can multiply `Math.random()` with the distance between the two numbers, then add the lower of the two numbers.

```java
int low = 10;
int high = 60;

double randomNumber = Math.random() * (high - low) + low; // random decimal number from 10 to 59.999...
```

If we want only integer results, we can cast the `double` to an `int`, which will truncate the number.

```java
int low = 10;
int high = 60 + 1; // the highest numnber is 60 but we need the +1 to include it

int randomNumber = (int)(Math.random() * (high - low) + low); // random integer from 10 to 60
```

### Random.randInt()

The `Random` class has a method called `nextInt()` that generates a random integer between 0 and a positive number. To use the `Random` class we need to import `java.util.Random`.

```java
int high = 60;

Random random = new Random(); 

int randomNumber = random.nextInt(high); // random integer from 0 to 60
```

If we want an integer between two specific values, we can add or subtract from the random number to get a number in the desired range.

```java
int low = 10;
int high = 60;

Random random = new Random(); 

int randomNumber = random.nextInt(high - low) + low; // random integer from 10 to 60
```

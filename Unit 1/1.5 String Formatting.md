### String Formatting

Suppose we want to print the date and we have variables for the month, day, and year.

One of the ways we could do that is to concatenate several strings together using the `+` operator.

```java
String month = "March";
String day = "14";
String year = "2015";

System.out.println(month + " " + day + ", " + year); 
```

Although this works, it's not easy to read and  spacing mistakes.

A better alternative is to use **string formatting**. String formatting involves using placeholders that get filled in with values of variables. Placeholders begin with `%` and the placeholder for string is `%s`

When we're printing, we can use `System.out.printf()`, where the "f" stands for *formatting*. This method takes a formatted string, followed by the variables that get filled in. 

```java
String month = "March";
String day = "14";
String year = "2015";

System.out.printf("%s %s, %s\n", month, day, year); 
```

## Print Statements

### The Console

The **console**, also known as the output window, is the default location where text gets printed to.

In Replit, the console is the black window on the right side of the screen.

### Hello World!

When using a programming language for the first time, it is traditional to run a program that prints "Hello World!".

The above image is an example of the Hello World program in Java using repl.it. When we hit *Run*, the text "Hello World!" is printed to the console. 

### System.out.println()

The most common method for printing in Java is `System.out.println()`. *Println* is pronounced as *print line*. When we use this method, it **must** be inside of the `main()` method or a custom method in order for it to work. We cannot use just `println()` on its own â€“ we need to write `System.out.println()` in full so that the interpreter knows where to find the method we're using (there may be different `println()` methods in other locations).

In the example above, `System.out.println()` takes the string `"Hello World!"`, but it can also take numbers, Booleans, characters, and other data types.

```java
System.out.println(7); // prints 7
```

However, it can only take one argument. There will be an error if there are multiple arguments.

```java
System.out.println("Hello", "World"!); // throws an error
```

We can concatenate strings using the `+` operator so that can print multiple strings at once

```java
System.out.println("Hello " + "World"!); // prints "Hello World!"
```


### System.out.print()

Another common method for printing in Java is `System.out.print()`. Notice that it does not have *ln* at the end. This method is similar to `System.out.println()`, except it does not place a newline character at the end of the output.

```java
// Prints "HelloWorld!" on one line. 
// Anything else will go immediately after "!" on the same line.
System.out.print("Hello");
System.out.print("World!");
```

```java
// Prints "Hello" and "World!" on two separate lines. 
// Anything else will go on a separate line.
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.println("World!");
```

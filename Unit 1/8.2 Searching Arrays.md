### Searching Arrays

A **standard `for` loop** can be used to iterate through an array by looking at each element one by one.

It would look something like this:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++) {
    // do something with arrayName[i]
}
```

To get the length of an array, use `arrayName.length`. The reason it's `length` and not `length()` is that `length` is an attribute, not a method. We'll learn about this in more detail in a later lesson.

In Java, the index of the first element of every array is 0. In the first iteration, `i` is 0; in the second iteration, `i` is 1; in the third iteration, `i` is 2; and so on until `i` is the last index of the array.

The last index is `arrayName.length - 1` since the first index is 0, which is why `<` is used in the condition instead of `<=`.  Alternatively, you could write `i <= arrayName.length - 1` as the condition, but it's not as nice looking as `i < arrayName.length`.


Another way of iterating through an array in Java is to use an **enhanced `for` loop**.

It would look something like this for an array of strings:

```java
for (String elem : array) {
    // do something with elem
}
```

If you're using an array of another data type, replace `String` with the correct data type.

For example, it would look something like this for an array of booleans:

```java
for (boolean elem : array) {
    // do something with elem
}
```

If we want to sort the values in an array, we can use `Arrays.sort()`.

```java
Arrays.sort(arrayName);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arrayName)); // prints the array with the elements in order
```

### Naming Methods

Recall how to create methods from [1.1 Introduction to Java](https://github.com/MissStrong/ICS4U/blob/main/Unit%201/1.1%20Introduction%20to%20Java.md).

> When defining a method, we would write the following, in order.    
> 1. `public`, `private`, or `protected` (or leave it blank for package-private)    
> 2. `static` (or leave it blank if it's non-static)    
> 3. the return type (e.g. `int`, `String`, etc.) (or write `void` if the method doesn't return anything)    
> 4. the name of the method    
> 5. the parameters of the method enclosed in parentheses    
> 6. a left curly brace `{`    
> 7. the content of the method    
> 8. a right curly brace `}`    


Here are the additional rules for naming our own methods:

* It can be a word or a phrase.
* It should contain start with a verb. 
* The first character is an lower case letter. The name cannot begin with a number.
* If there is more than one word, all other words begins with a capital (e.g. `getItem()`).
* There are only letters and numbers. There are no underscores or other special symbols.

Here is an example of some custom methods.

```java
public static void print(String s) {
    System.out.println(s);
}

public static void print(int num) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

We are allowed to use the same method name for multiple methods in the program as long as the parameters are different data types or there is a different number of paramaters. This is called **method overloading**.

### Documenting Methods

We may have been wondering what these recurring lines of code are for:

```java
/**
 * @param args the command line arguments
 * @return void
 */
```

This is the documentation for the `main()` method. It is placed directly above the first line of the `main()` method. It tells the user that `main()` is a method that has one parameter, called `args`, and it represents the command line arguments. 

When we create our own methods, we should document them, too.

```java
/**
 * Takes the length and width of a rectangle and returns the rectangle's area.
 *
 * @param l the length of the rectangle
 * @param w the width of the rectangle
 * @return the area of the rectangle
 */
```

When we are documenting a method, the following information should be stated:
* A brief description of what the method is for.
* The parameter names and what conditions they have (e.g. can be any integer, must be an integer greater than 2, etc.).
* What the method returns, unless nothing is returned.
* Any side effects of the method (e.g. static variables changing values, information printed to the output window, etc.).

```java
/**
 * Takes the side lengths of a triangle and returns the triangle's perimeter.
 *
 * @param a the first side length of the triangle
 * @param b the second side length of the triangle
 * @param c the third side length of the triangle
 * @return the perimeter of the triangle
 */ 
public static double perimeter(double a, double b, double c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```

In computer science, **parameters** are the variable names used in a method. **Arguments** are the values of the parameters we use when we are calling a method. If we call `perimeter(3, 4, 5)`, the parameters are `a`, `b`, `c` and the arguments are `3`, `4`, `5`.

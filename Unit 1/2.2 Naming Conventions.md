### Naming Notations

In different programming languages, there are different rules for naming. Here are some of the common notations used.

| Notation Name    | Example                  | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lower Camel Case       | thisIsLowerCamelCase          | Every word begins with a capital, except for the first word.<br/><br/>All other letters are lowercase. |
| Upper Camel Case      | ThisIsUpperCamelCase         | Every word begins with a capital.<br/><br/>All other letters are lowercase. |
| Snake Case       | this_is_snake_case       | Every letter is lowercase.<br/><br/>Words are separated with underscores. |

### Naming Conventions for Java

* Variable names should begin with a lowercase letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore. (Beginning a variable name with a dollar sign or underscore serves a specific purpose. Google it if you're curious.)
* Variable names should include only letters and numbers (with the exception of a possible dollar sign or underscore at the very beginning).
* Variable names and method names should use **camel case**.
* Constant names should use **screaming snake case**. This is snake case with all letters capitalized. (Think of it as screaming or yelling.)
* Classes should use **upper camel case**.

In general, we should use descriptive names for variables to help create code that is self-explanatory.

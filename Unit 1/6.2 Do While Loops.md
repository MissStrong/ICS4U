### Do While Loops

A *while loop* checks the condition before running the block of code. If we want the condition to be checked after the block of code is run once, we can use a *do while loop*. 

Here is the general structure of a *do while loop*.

```java
do {
    <statement>;
    â‹®
    <statement>;
} while (<condition>);
```

Here's an example where we want the user to enter a integer from 1 to 10, and if they don't do that it will keep asking them.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int num;

do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number from 1 to 10: ");
    num = scanner.nextInt(); 

    if (num > 10) {
        System.out.println("Too high!");
    } else if (num < 1) {
        System.out.println("Too low!");
    }
} while (num > 10 || num < 1);

System.out.println("Thanks!");
```

The separate declaration `int num;` is necssary so that the condition in the while loop does not have an out-of-scope variable.

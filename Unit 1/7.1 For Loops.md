### For Loops

We would generally use a *for loop* when we know how many times we want the block of code to* run.

Here is the general structure of a *for loop.

```java
for (<initialization>; <condition>; <incrementation>) {
    <statement>;
    â‹®
    <statement>;
}
```

A *for loop* does the following:

1. Performs the initialization. 
2. Checks to see whether the condition is met. If it isn't met, the block doesn't run.
3. If the condition is met, it runs the block of code (the content within the curly braces).
4. Performs the incrementation.
5. Repeats steps 2-4 repeatedly until the condition is no longer met in step 2.

Here's an example of printing all the integers from 0 to 10:

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

If we just want the even numbers, we can use a different incrementation.

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i+=2) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

Here's an example of a countdown from 100 to 0:

```java
for (int i = 100; i >= 0; i--) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Infinite Loops

If a condition is never reached, a loop will run indefinitely until the program is stopped.

```java
for (int i = 1; i != 10; i += 2) {
    doSomething(); // repeats indefinitely since the condition i != 10 is never reached
}
```

## Computer Science Research

**Computer Science research** is conducted in many areas in an attempt to keep up with this demand for technological advancement.

There are many different areas of Computer Science research. For example, some research falls under the title of theoretical research, while other research involves collaborative research between Computer Science and other fields.

Robotics, data mining, computer vision, image processing, logic, cryptography, and graph theory are all areas of theoretical Computer Science research. Artificial Intelligence is the branch of Computer Science that is concerned with making computers behave like humans. This includes a wide variety of applications such as expert systems, game playing, robotics, natural language, neural networks, and many more.


### Did you know?

* There are expert computer systems with the ability to help doctors diagnose diseases based on a patient's symptoms.
* The best computer chess programs are now capable of beating the best human chess players.
* Computer-controlled robots are now widely used in assembly plants.

Some areas of Computer Science research include collaborative research between computer science and other fields of study. For example, **bioinformatics** is a field in which computer technology is applied to the management of biological information.

Another example of collaborative research is **GIS** (Geographic Information Systems) where geography and computer science work together to gather, analyze, and produce information related to the surface of the Earth. The data from GIS exists as maps, 3D virtual models, tables, and lists that may be used for a wide variety of tasks.

Other areas for collaborative research include geology, economics, linguistics, health informatics, climatology, sociology, and art.

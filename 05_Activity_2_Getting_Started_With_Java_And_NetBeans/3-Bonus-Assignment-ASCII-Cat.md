### Instructions

1. Go to File > New Project. Name the project ASCIICat.

2. Write `Bonus Assignment 1 - ASCII Cat` as a comment at the top of the file. 

3. Determine how to use `System.out.println()` in order to get this cat to print to the output window. 

4. Zip the file and name it **Bonus Assignment 1 - \<insert your name here>.zip**.

5. Submit both the .zip file and .java file separately to the Dropbox.
  

Why is this a Bonus Assignment, you ask? The " and \ symbols in the image cause complications that you'll have to figure out.


For convenience, here are the characters used in the cat.
```
.        .
\'-"'"-'/
 } 6 6 {
 =. Y  ,=
  /^^^\ .
 /     \ ) 
 ( )-( )/ 
  "" ""
  ```

## Learning Skills Self-Evaluation

Before you move on to Activities 5 and 6, please take the time to reflect on your learning skills so far.

The six learning skills evaluated on Ontario report cards are:
* Responsibility
* Organization
* Independent Work
* Collaboration
* Initiative
* Self-Regulation

These are all skills that online classrooms can help you develop since you don't have as much guidance as you would in a traditional classroom.

By now, you've probably recognized which of these skills are strengths and which ones are weaknesses. I have my own opinions about each of your learning skills based on what I've seen in this learning environment, but your own thoughts on these skills matter to me, too.

Please take the time to complete this [Learning Skills Self-Evaluation](https://goo.gl/forms/Sg9yXLi3N3SK40cn2).Â You will be asked to evaluate your learning skills and set goals for the ones you want to improve on.

If you find that you are evaluating your learning skills poorly (e.g. Satisfactory and Needs Improvement for every learning skill), now would be a good time to set some meaningful goals so you can devise plans to improve these.

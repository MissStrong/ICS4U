## Note – Ethical Computer Use

### Ethical and Social Implications of Computer Use

We live in a time which is often referred to as the “information age.” We now have the ability through the use of technology, to store and manipulate large amounts of information.

As a young person completing secondary school and preparing to enter postsecondary education or the work force, it is important that you are aware of both social and ethical implications related to how you use your computer and communication technology.

Most people would agree that computers can be used to do a lot of amazing things; however, they can also be misused.

Examples of Computer Misuse:
* downloading of copyright protected files (e.g. music, videos)
* plagiarism and copying
* loss of productivity in the workplace
* identity theft
* software piracy
* cyberbullying

Knowing some simple ethical guidelines can help ensure your safety and help you to behave in a way that is morally right when you are using a computer.

### Using a Computer at School or in the Workplace

The first thing to remember when you are working at a computer at school or in the workplace is that the computer is there to help you get your work done.

Sending personal email, playing games, or looking at offensive material on the Internet is inappropriate computer use.

It may seem harmless to complete personal tasks while at school or work; however, according to SpectorSoft, employees average 45 minutes EVERY day doing personal web surfing! When you consider the number of employees in an organization, this can really add up and create productivity problems for employers.

### Internet Acceptable Use Policy

Many institutions (schools and employers) publish Acceptable Use Policies which typically contain rules and guidelines regarding computer use. These guidelines suggest that employees

* use appropriate language
* do not access, upload, download, or distribute inappropriate materials
* do not share passwords or access another user's account
* do not add, delete, or modify installed software.

### Computer Monitoring

Did you know that it is legal for employers to install software programs to monitor employee computer use?

Hidden software can be used to watch everything users do while they are on a computer. This software monitors websites, emails sent and received, chats and instant messages, keystrokes typed, files transferred, documents printed, and applications run.

Internet filtering software can also be used to control what sites computers within an organization are able to visit.

Some people argue that employers who use this type of software are invading the privacy of their employees. However, it should be noted that companies who fail to properly monitor their employees' Internet behaviour can be held responsible for harm caused to third parties as a result of an employee's inappropriate use of a workplace computer. For example, an American company was held liable for the actions of an employee who uploaded child pornography from his workplace computer.

It is very important to always remember that nothing you write or upload on the web is completely private, including email and instant messages - so be careful and think about what you type, what you upload, and whom you talk to.

### Ethics for Computer Programmers

Computer programmers are IT (Information Technology) professionals, and they are responsible for the computer software they create. Schools, governments, and other employers rely on IT professionals to maintain their computer systems.

Computer programmers must ensure, to the best of their ability, that the software they create is reliable. This means that it is their ethical responsibility to use appropriate methods and tools to test and evaluate programs before they are distributed. This is especially important in cases where computer software is being used to control devices such as medical equipment, aircraft, and nuclear reactors.

Computer programmers must also consider the impact they have on computer users. Web users, for example, often rely on data from websites which provide real-time information. Programmers involved in these types of projects must be careful to provide efficient, secure, and accurate methods for data retrieval.

There are several professional associations composed of IT professionals whose purpose it is to provide support, resources, and guidelines for the advancement of technology.

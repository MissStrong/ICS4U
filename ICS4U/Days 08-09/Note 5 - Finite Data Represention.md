## Note – Finite Data Representation

### Integer Overflow and Underflow

All computers use a fixed number of bits to represent data. This means that there are limits as to what integers a program can use.  

Java uses 32-bit data representation for integers: The lowest integer it can store is –2<sup>31</sup> and the highest integer it can store is 2<sup>31</sup> – 1. You can use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to obtain these values.

When you try to compute a value beyond this domain, it is called **integer overflow** (beyond `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) or **integer underflow** (beyond `Integer.MIN_VALUE`).

### Imprecision of Double and Float

Programming languages tend to be poor at accurately dividing long decimal numbers due to finite data representation. Be aware that if a calculation in any of your programs seems to be off, it might be that your algorithm may be fine and Java simply can't perform the calculation accurately. 

If precision is important in your program, you can use data types that take up more space (and are thus more precise), such as `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`.

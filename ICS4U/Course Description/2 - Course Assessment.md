These violations will be dealt with in a severe manner and may result in suspension or expulsion. __Please remember, any communications on the Internet, whether through email, private chat room, or other methods are not private. Be aware that anything you communicate may be viewed by others.__ If you don't want it known, do not type it into your computer.

### WCI Policies - Late and Missing Work

WCI's policy regarding late and missed assignments is in effect. The policy can be found in the Student/Parent Handbook. Here is the policy you will be adhering to:

*At WCI it is the expectation that students will submit all required work by the assigned due dates as evidence of their learning. Students who fail to meet a due date and/or deadline for assignment, test or performance task may be subject to the Completion Policy flowchart (see below). Failure to submit this work by the deadline, despite these interventions, will be recorded as incomplete and may result in a loss of credit. Lateness is an issue of student responsibility and time management, as well as academic fairness. Students are responsible for providing evidence of their achievement of the overall expectations within a time frame established by teacher. As stated in WRDSB Procedure 1660, marks are not deducted for major assignments (i.e., assignments that comprise part of the critical body of evidence for evaluation and reporting purposes) that are handed in late; rather, instances of lateness can be reflected in the studentâ€™s Learning Skills. Major assignments will be clearly communicated by the course teacher.*

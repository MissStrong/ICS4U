## Note: Pair Programming 

### What is Pair Programming?

Pair programming involves two programmers working together at a single workstation. Only one of them can type at once. Typically, one of the programmers (the **driver**) writes the code while the other (the **navigator**) watches, gives directions, provides real-time feedback, and is on the lookout for issues that could potentially rise. This allows one of the programmers to focus on writing the code while the other guides them. The two roles can be swapped at any time.

### Learning Through Pair Programming

Pair programming is an excellent way of gaining new knowledge and insight. This is especially true when at least one of the programmers is a beginner (not necessarily new to programming – they could be new to the language or new to the type of project they're working on). When the pair consists of two beginners, they can troubleshoot together and bounce their ideas off of each other. When the pair consists of an expert and a beginner, the beginner is constantly gaining knowledge from the expert and the expert is solidifying their own programming practices. 

### Virtual Pair Programming

Virtual pair programming is a variation of pair programming in which the two programmers are not in the same physical location. They use a collaborative real-time editor that may or may not allow them to write code at the same time, although there should be only one person writing code at a time. This variation of pair programming introduces new issues such as lag, verbal miscommunication, and conflicts.

### Potential Issues with Pair Programming

#### Distractions

As the Navigator, try not to get distracted. If you are checking your phone, the Driver may get upset that you are not doing your job of checking their code as they are writing it.

#### Micro-Managing

As the Navigator, don't give instructions with petty details that undermine the Driver's abilities. For example, spelling out common words and explaining obvious things should be avoided (unless the Driver specificially asks about it).

#### Impatience

As the Navigator, don't immediately point out an error right when you see it. The Driver may quickly notice it and fix it themselves. If you intervene too soon, this can needlessly disrupt to the driver's thinking process and flow. Wait at least five seconds after you see an error before saying anything.

#### Keyboard Hogging

Be mindful of how long you are spending as the Driver. If you are controlling the keyboard all the time, it can be frustrating for your partner who is eager to do some typing too. Switch roles often to keep things fresh.

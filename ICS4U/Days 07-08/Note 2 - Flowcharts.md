### Flowchart Symbols

There are over 20 standard symbols used in flowcharts, but you only need to know these four for this activity.

### Creating Flowcharts 

You can create flowcharts on Google Docs using the Drawing tool. Go to **Insert>Drawing**, then select the **Shapes** tool. You can drag and drop them onto the drawing area then save the drawing to place it onto the document.

You can also create flowcharts using Microsoft Office software (e.g. Word, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc.) using the **Shapes** tool. 

There are also many free flowchart-making software, such as [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

Drawing them by hand isn't too bad, either.

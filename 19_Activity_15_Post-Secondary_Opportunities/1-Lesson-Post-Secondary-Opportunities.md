## Post-Secondary Opportunities

### Careers

Information Technology (**IT**) has improved the way we work and live, making it easier to manage everything from manufacturing processes to home finances. Every day, new innovations increase the use of IT in our lives.

The more we use new products and gadgets, the greater the demand for improved versions of these products. All hi-tech products are run by programs or software; all software is written by programmers with training in Computer Science. As a result, demand is high for people who wish to pursue careers in Computer Science and Information Technology.

According to a Labour Force Survey conducted by the **ICTC** (Information and Communications Technology Council), more than 625 000 Canadians work in the IT sector as of November 2010. Despite the recession, the unemployment rate in the IT sector is only just above 3%, which is much lower than the national average for the Canadian workforce. Ontario has the highest IT employment, with 46% of all Canadian IT jobs in our province.

Given the potential for an exciting career in the IT sector, it is important to stay in touch with what's happening in information technology. Just think, in a few years, you could have a positive impact on Canada and the world with a hi-tech innovation of your own!

Choosing a career at this point in your educational journey is a difficult one. Many of you are struggling with the questions, "Where do I go from here? Do I go to the workplace? Do I go to university? Do I go to college? Do I take time off to make a more informed decision?" Perhaps the following resources will help you find some answers.


### Definitions

**Computer Science** deals with the theory and practice of computer hardware and software. The theory underlies computation and how to develop effective, efficient, and correct software.

**Computer Security** focuses on the privacy of personal data, preventing unauthorized access to computer systems, ensuring back-up contingency plans in the event of data loss, and protecting systems from malicious activity.

**Computer Engineering** looks at how fundamental engineering design principles can be used to develop computer software and hardware.

**Information Technology** deals with the application of technology in a business or organization. Information Technology programs deal with how technology can be applied, rather than the technology itself.

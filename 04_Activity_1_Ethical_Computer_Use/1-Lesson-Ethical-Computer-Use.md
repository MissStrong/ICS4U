### Ethical and Social Implications of Computer Use

We live in a time which is often referred to as the “information age.” We now have the ability through the use of technology, to store and manipulate large amounts of information.

As a young person completing secondary school and preparing to enter postsecondary education or the work force, it is important that you are aware of both social and ethical implications related to how you use your computer and communication technology.

Most people would agree that computers can be used to do a lot of amazing things; however, they can also be misused.

Examples of Computer Misuse:
* downloading of copyright protected files (e.g. music, videos)
* plagiarism and copying
* loss of productivity in the workplace
* identity theft
* software piracy
* cyberbullying

Knowing some simple ethical guidelines can help ensure your safety and help you to behave in a way that is morally right when you are using a computer.

### General Netiquette Guidelines

* Do not spam. Spam is junk e-mail (including chain letters) and a billion-dollar problem which clogs mail systems and wastes time.
* Do not flame. A flame is an aggressive or insulting e-mail or message.
* Behave as though you were communicating face-to-face honestly, ethically, and wisely.
* Remember that words can be misinterpreted, and things like sarcasm and irony may not come across properly in online communication.
* Do not SHOUT. Make sure your Caps Lock key is off.
* Do not distribute copyrighted information. Just because something is on the Internet does not mean that it is free for you to use.

### Using a Computer at School or in the Workplace

The first thing to remember when you are working at a computer at school or in the workplace is that the computer is there to help you get your work done.

Sending personal e-mail, playing games, or looking at offensive material on the Internet is inappropriate computer use.

It may seem harmless to complete personal tasks while at school or work; however, according to SpectorSoft, employees average 45 minutes EVERY day doing personal web surfing! When you consider the number of employees in an organization, this can really add up and create productivity problems for employers.

### Internet Acceptable Use Policy

Many institutions (schools and employers) publish Acceptable Use Policies which typically contain rules and guidelines regarding computer use. These guidelines suggest that employees

* use appropriate language
* do not access, upload, download, or distribute inappropriate materials
* do not share passwords or access another user's account
* do not add, delete, or modify installed software.

### Computer Monitoring

Did you know that it is legal for employers to install software programs to monitor employee computer use?

Hidden software can be used to watch everything users do while they are on a computer. This software monitors websites, e-mails sent and received, chats and instant messages, keystrokes typed, files transferred, documents printed, and applications run.

Internet filtering software can also be used to control what sites computers within an organization are able to visit.

Some people argue that employers who use this type of software are invading the privacy of their employees. However, it should be noted that companies who fail to properly monitor their employees' Internet behaviour can be held responsible for harm caused to third parties as a result of an employee's inappropriate use of a workplace computer. For example, an American company was held liable for the actions of an employee who uploaded child pornography from his workplace computer. To read more about this case, a link has been included in the Resources section of this page.

It is very important to always remember that nothing you write or upload on the web is completely private, including e-mail and instant messages - so be careful and think about what you type, what you upload, and who you talk to.

### Internet Safety Issues

All Internet users need to be aware of possible threats to their safety and of how to protect their physical well-being as well as their personal information.

### Cyberbullying 

Cyberbullying involves the use of the Internet or cell phones to send hurtful messages or post information to damage people's reputation and friendships.

* Don't put yourself at risk for Cyberbullying.
* Don't post or send information others could use against you.
* Watch how you are communicating. Do not insult others.
* Don't visit places where people are treating you badly.

### What can you do if you are cyberbullied?

* DON'T strike back! This will only encourage the bully and could make other people think you are part of the problem.
* Try to figure out the identity of the cyberbully, and save evidence of the incident.
* Decide whether you can handle the situation by yourself or if you should tell an adult.
* If you attempt to solve the problem on your own and it does not work, be sure to get help from an adult.
* Depending on how bad the cyberbullying, the steps you or a parent can take include:
  * Calmly and strongly tell the cyberbully to stop and to remove any harmful material or risk further action.
  * Ignore or block the communications.
  * Send the posted material to the cyberbully's parents and ask them to make it stop.
  * File a complaint with the website, ISP, or cell phone company.
  * Get help from your school counsellor, principal, or resource officer.
  * Contact an attorney.
  * Contact the police if the cyberbullying includes any threats.

### Identity Theft

Identity theft is the use of your personal information (possibly stolen electronically) in order to make fraudulent purchases or loans. Identity theft is a growing crime affecting many ordinary citizens.

How to protect your identity?

* Use different user ID and password combinations for different accounts. Combine letters and numbers to make your passwords more complicated and change them on a regular basis.
* Never provide personal information such as SIN, date of birth, credit card numbers, or PIN over the telephone or online unless you initiate the call or communication.
* Sign all credit cards when you receive them.
* Never lend your credit cards to anyone.
* Immediately report lost or stolen credit cards and any discrepancies in your monthly statements to the issuing credit card company.

Many common Internet activities may not seem dangerous on the surface, but can result in threats to your personal safety.

Members of the RCMP and Police forces from Canada's National Capital Region have worked together to create a website called [Internet Safety](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/is-si/) to help youth remain safe while using the Internet.

On this website, you can find tips related to how to safely use the Internet. You can also view videos and learn about real-life Internet experiences of teenagers whose personal safety was at risk.

### True stories in which personal safety was threatened:

* File Sharing - a teenage boy faces legal troubles when he shares personal photos and videos with a friend.
* Internet Luring - a teenage girl is lured by an online predator.
* Online Gaming - a virtual game turns into real life danger.
* Blogging - a teenage boy learns how easy it is for a person to lie about his/her identity and intentions in web blogs.
* Using a Webcam - a teenage girl's webcam is turned against her.
* Cyberbullying - real world bullies enter cyberspace.


### Ethics for Computer Programmers

Computer programmers are IT (Information Technology) professionals, and they are responsible for the computer software they create. Schools, governments, and other employers rely on IT professionals to maintain their computer systems.

Computer programmers must ensure, to the best of their ability, that the software they create is reliable. This means that it is their ethical responsibility to use appropriate methods and tools to test and evaluate programs before they are distributed. This is especially important in cases where computer software is being used to control devices such as medical equipment, aircraft, and nuclear reactors.

Computer programmers must also consider the impact they have on computer users. Web users, for example, often rely on data from websites which provide real-time information. Programmers involved in these types of projects must be careful to provide efficient, secure, and accurate methods for data retrieval.

There are several professional associations composed of IT professionals whose purpose it is to provide support, resources, and guidelines for the advancement of technology.


### Example

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is such an organization. Founded in 1947, the ACM publishes information relating to computer science, holds seminars, and promotes computer standards.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), dating back to 1884, is an organization composed of engineers, scientists, and students. The IEEE is best known for developing technical standards for the computer and electronics industry.

Both of these organizations publish a Code of Ethics to be followed by their members.

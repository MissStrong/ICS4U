### E-waste

Did you know that landfills all across the world contain mountains of electronic waste? Electronic devices are widely used in both homes and offices and many of these devices are being replaced every day with faster and smaller devices. In North America, most of the electronic waste generated from American households and businesses is buried in landfill sites.

One problem with this is that valuable metals such as copper are lost. A larger problem is that rainwater washes the metals out of the electronic waste and into the soil or the groundwater. Both humans and animals ingest these heavy metals via the water supply, which can result in serious health hazards.

Electronic waste that does not find its way into landfills is often collected and then sent either to China or to any one of a number of African countries where it is then reprocessedâ€” sometimes under very dangerous conditions.

Electronic waste is referred to as **e-waste** and includes computers, entertainment equipment, telecommunication equipment, as well as cooling appliances and other devices.

  
Many countries are now trying to find ways to reduce the impact of computers and related technologies on the environment. Governments are introducing guidelines and regulations for the collection and recycling of e-waste in their countries

It is important that both citizens and their governments strive to find ways to use computers and computer hardware wisely to protect human health and the future of our planet.

Some suggestions:
* turn off computers and monitors at the end of the day
* recycle printer cartridges
* upgrade instead of buying a new PC
* recycle
* re-use
* reduce
